Now is the time to get answers about what steps are necessary to manage your depression. Overwhelmed by a Mental Health Diagnosis? Find a Licensed Therapist to Help You Cope Acknowledge and Accept That You Needed Help A diagnosis such as major depression may be difficult to hear even if you had suspected for some time. You may have a rush of emotions running through your mind as you wonder what will happen next. Some feel relieved to know that what they have been experiencing has a name. Some feel hopeful because they can learn options to help them feel better. Others may deny their diagnosis and find it hard to accept. You may feel shameful if you see it as a personal flaw. Some experience confusion if they think their issues don't line up with the diagnosis. Others may question why they feel angry. Some think their life will not be the same or feel guilty and think it is their fault. You may feel powerless because you don't know what to do. Experiencing negative thoughts is normal, and it may seem overwhelming to take in such a diagnosis. Over time, you will learn more insight into treatment options and how to adapt your life to manage your symptoms. Dealing with a depressive disorder is challenging, and it is okay to take your time to figure things out. It may take time to understand how your life may change and how the diagnosis may define it. As you know more about your diagnosis, it helps to acknowledge what you have done so far to get to this point. There is nothing wrong with seeking help. Doing so can help you realize you deserve better for yourself. It Is Not Your Fault First off, don't be hard on yourself. It is common to wonder why you have a depressive disorder. While much is learned over the years about depression, researchers are still exploring contributing factors behind its cause. You may wonder if you somehow caused your symptoms to appear.  However, depression has nothing to do with personal character flaws or weaknesses. Several different things may contribute to developing depression, including things out of your control.  Many diagnosed with major depression may have a family history. Someone in your family may have dealt with similar symptoms. Some studies claim women are more likely to be diagnosed than men. A life-changing event such as the birth of a baby, career change, or relationship conflicts may lead to being depressed. Other medical problems such as substance abuse or chronic pain may cause symptoms, especially if you have an unknown underlying health problem. Seasonal changes and how you view the world around you may be contributing factors for persistent depressive disorder. Sometimes a cause is unknown. While it may help to understand what led to your symptoms, the important thing is that you recognized your mental health needs special attention. Research More About Depression While you may know the basics about the symptoms of depression, it is crucial to keep learning beyond the necessary information. You'll want to review ways symptoms may interfere with daily living. Learn about ways to cope â€“ such as treatments, support groups, and self-help options. Gain insight into what to expect during the treatment process. Spend time making sense of your diagnosis to understand realistic expectations for your journey to recovery. Collecting information helps you see you are an individual with a diagnosis, and the diagnosis does not define who you are. Explore effective treatment options such as cognitive behavioral therapy and understand how they work. As you learn more about living with a depressive disorder, there are significant details you'll want to keep in mind to guide you during research. As you seek recent, credible information, consider aspects based on evidence. Such sources will have up to date data from researchers such as academic journals, mental health organizations, and other related resources. You'll also want to learn more about other people's experiences with depression through community support groups, organizations, etc. You may learn practical ideas for overcoming personal challenges. Assessing Treatment Options Even with a persistent depressive disorder, recovery is achievable with the right treatment plan. Upon learning your diagnosis, you may have questions about treatment options. Options may include a combination of medication and talk therapy. You may also make changes to daily living activities to reflect a healthier lifestyle. There are different ways to create a treatment plan, and there is no one size fits all approach. It is vital to work with your doctor or mental health specialist to get the most benefits from your treatment plan. Some living with a depressive disorder may need changes or adjustments made to their treatments. It is a normal part of recovery because circumstances change, and you want your treatment plan to reflect changes to ensure you stay on track. It may take time to adjust to your plan, and some parts may pass faster than others. Establishing excellent communication with your mental health specialist is significant because he or she will help you reach milestones and set goals. Overwhelmed by a Mental Health Diagnosis? Find a Licensed Therapist to Help You Cope Your treatment plan is based on the symptoms you experience.  If you have major depression, your plan may focus on improving your mood. If you have bipolar depression, your plan may focus on establishing a balance between high and low moods. Your treatment plan may also be based on your insurance and personal preferences. Handle Your Diagnosis with a Plan Create an action plan to navigate your diagnosis. Start by making notes of what you want to accomplish. Make an effort to keep your appointments and take advantage of the time you have with your healthcare provider when you meet with them. If you're diagnosed with major depression, it may include questions to discuss with your healthcare provider about your condition. Maybe your plan will focus on achieving specific goals to gain a better outlook about your diagnosis. People with persistent depressive disorder may have questions about their treatment, but your plan may include when to expect to follow up answers. Your plan may detail other actions you will take to ensure your treatment achieves favorable results. Take notes on what tasks you'll need to complete. Make a list of people to add to your list of supporters when you need someone to talk to. It may include friends, family members, and peers from support groups. Your plan may consist of therapy sessions and making time to find a compatible therapist. Other notable details to add in your plan may include when to reassess your goals and ways you'll maintain looking after yourself. Establish a Support Network People with depression may isolate themselves from others. Having a support network is critical when dealing with a diagnosis. A depressed person may not want to be around others due to feeling shame or guilt. If you expect to overcome your condition, social interaction is a must. Support from people that care about you is essential. Some people close to you may have suspected you're depressed beforehand. Let them know about your diagnosis. You may be surprised by their support and encouragement. People with the persistent depressive disorder may find support as helpful motivation. Sometimes you may struggle to have a good day or to get tasks done. Having a support system helps you be accountable for your actions, but also, you'll know where to turn when you need help from people you can depend on. Relief and Recovery: Ways You Can Help Yourself Your road to recovery with a depressive disorder may change as your needs change.   You will need to allow yourself time and compassion. Things may take time to develop because symptoms may be a hindrance. It is the perfect time to review your living habits and start implementing changes to encourage results. Plan on getting to bed early, making changes to your diet, create an exercise routine, and make social plans with friends. Think about activities you can do when you feel sad. Make an effort to be consistent with your actions. Some days you may feel low on energy, and that is okay. Continue taking prescribed meds and plan on attending upcoming appointments. You'll still be moving forward even on days where your efforts are limited. Soon you'll notice symptoms fading and other areas of your life improving, such as your energy, mood, sleep, and appetite. Take advantage of getting involved with people and activities you enjoy the most. Any negative thoughts you experience are due to your depression. Stay focused on improving your lifestyle and wellbeing. Stay active and avoid alcohol. Keep stress to a minimum and learn stress management techniques. Consider working with a therapist. Online therapy support options provide comprehensive insight on dealing with major depression and other mental health concerns. Adjusting to your diagnosis takes time and requires patience. Having realistic expectations about your recovery, along with persistent action and support, will help you get the results you want.",2022-09-01,Coping strategies
Depression In Older Adults: Can It Develop After Retirement?,BetterHelp,"As people age, their physical and mental health conditions begin to deteriorate. Many older people have gone their entire lives without having to deal with mental or emotional issues. If an older person should develop depression later in life, their friends and family members might be asking: Can depression develop after retirement? Facing New Mental Health Challenges After Retirement? Get the Support You Need In Therapy Depression is also called major depressive disorder or clinical depression. It can occur in people of any age, including children. While depression is common in older people, it's considered a normal part of aging. Depression is a medical condition where the symptoms won't generally subside without treatment. Regardless of how old you are when you get it, you can't just shake it off as so many people mistakenly assume that you can.
 Recognizing Symptoms of Depression in Older Adults For the most part, many of the symptoms of depression are the same across ages. In certain aspects, depression in older adults can look different than it does at other ages. For many people living with depression, their main symptom of depression is sadness. Older adults may have symptoms that are less obvious or that are masked by more noticeable problems. Older people may not admit to being sad and may not want to talk about it. Instead, you may notice that they're tired all the time during the day; yet, they have trouble sleeping at night. Some older people with depression have a primary symptom of just being grumpy and irritable or complain of pains and headaches. Depression can cause confusion or attention problems in older adults. Some people may mistake these symptoms as Alzheimer's disease or another brain disorder. Older people also tend to have greater physical health issues. Such medical conditions as heart disease, stroke, or cancer may contribute to depressive symptoms. Seniors often take medications for various conditions and those drugs may have side effects that contribute to depression. Certain other factors like the psychological effects of dealing with the death of a spouse or loved one or dealing with having to move to a different home or facility might cause depression, and these experiences can be traumatic for older people and compound the problem of existing depression. Some older people tend to adapt better to life's trials. Types of Depression in Older People There are different types of depression and most types can affect older people just as easily as they affect anyone else. Major depressive disorder is perhaps the most common type of depression in older people. Major depression may occur during their younger years and may reappear during their senior years or it may exist continuously throughout their lifetimes. The symptoms of major depression will interfere with their ability to sleep, eat, and enjoy life. Persistent depressive disorder is also known as PDD. This is a type of depression that lasts for at least two years. A person living with persistent depressive disorder may have times of major depression along with periods of milder symptoms over those two years. Psychotic depression is a type of major depressive disorder when some form of psychosis is present along with the depression. Psychosis may be in the form of hallucinations, delusions, or some other type of break with reality. Hallucinations may cause them to hear or see things that don't exist. Delusions may manifest as having feelings of worthlessness, failure, or having committed some type of sin. Still another type of depression that can affect older adults is seasonal affective disorder, or SAD. Seasonal affective disorder typically surfaces when the weather gets cold and gloomy with shorter hours of sunlight. The symptoms are the same as for clinical depression and they may subside when the weather turns warmer. Changes in a person's body and brain as they age can also cause depression for the first time later in life. Many older adults have restricted blood flow which is called ischemia. Over time, the condition can worsen and prevent blood from flowing normally to the brain and other organs. This is called vascular depression and it can occur in people that don't have a family history of depression. Older people with vascular depression may also be at risk of developing heart disease, having a heart attack, or having some other type of vascular illness.   What Causes Depression in Older Adults? Several things are contributing causes of depression in older adults. Depression is often genetic. People that have other members of the family living with depression may be more susceptible to getting depression after  retirement. People that have had depressive episodes during their younger years may find that they are more susceptible to getting depression later in life. Brain chemistry also affects moods and some people have the brain chemistry that predisposes them to depression symptoms. Stress also has a major bearing on depression in older people. Seniors that are stressed may trigger depression if they've lost a loved one, are in a difficult relationship, or are stressed because of their illness or living conditions. Depression and Parkinson's Disease Parkinson's disease is a common disease in older people, and it can cause depression and anxiety along with it. The Parkinson's Foundation estimates that at least 50% of people that have been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease will experience some type of depression during their illness and up to 40% of them will develop an anxiety disorder. The Parkinson's Foundation reports that mood, depression, and anxiety have the greatest impact on an older person and may contribute even more than the irregularities in motor control. Older people with Parkinson's disease may react to a formal diagnosis of Parkinson's disease with grief. It's important to consider that normal sadness and grief are different than depression. Sadness and grief are temporary whereas depression is persistent and lasts at least two weeks, and often, longer. Parkinson's disease causes changes in the brain's chemistry and in addition to affecting a person's motor function, chemical changes in the brain also cause depression along with Parkinson's disease. Specifically, Parkinson's disease creates changes in the levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, which are the chemicals that help to regulate mood, motivation, appetite, sleep, and energy. These chemical changes can occur even before an older person begins to experience the changes in their motor ability that are so characteristic of Parkinson's disease, which means that a person may exhibit symptoms of depression first before they notice signs of Parkinson's disease. Depression can magnify the cognitive and motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Researchers believe that by treating depression, it may improve the quality of movement, and thus, the quality of life for older people living with Parkinson's disease. In treating the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, the co-occurring symptoms of depression are often overlooked and undertreated. It's important to treat both afflictions at the same time for the best results. Facing New Mental Health Challenges After Retirement? Get the Support You Need In Therapy Depression and Its Connection to Eating Disorders in Older Adults According to a study published in the journal Nutrients, 78% of deaths that are attributable to anorexia occur in elderly people. Poor nutrition can exacerbate chronic illnesses in the older population. Depression in women among seniors may result in eating disorders more often than in elderly men. Eating disorders are a serious matter for older people because their bodies don't have the resilience that they had during their younger years. While many people tend to associate anorexia with girls and younger women, depression in women in their senior years is also of great concern. Older women are also concerned with their body image. A study of 1,000 women between the ages of 60 and 70 indicates that 80% of them controlled their body weight and 60% weren't happy with their bodies. Some older people have difficulty eating for other reasons. Some have poor dental health or poorly fitting dentures, making it difficult for them to eat and chew their food. In addition, certain medications may contribute to the malabsorption of nutrients or loss of appetite. Older people that experience gastrointestinal issues may not feel as much like eating. In addition to these issues, many older people simply aren't as active as they were when they were young, and they don't need as many calories as they use to, so they just don't feel like they need to eat. How to Prevent or Lessen the Impact of Depression in Older People It may be that there isn't anything that you can do to prevent depression in older people. What you may be successful in is anticipating the types of problems that can lead to post-retirement depression and take steps to head it off. For example, for older people that need to move away from their family homes, help to prepare them mentally for the move as best you can. Visit them in their new spaces as often as possible so that you can assess how they're adjusting to their new surroundings.  Encourage them to eat and get regular exercise to keep their bodies as healthy as possible. Address any physical illnesses at the earliest opportunity. The good news about depression in older adults is that it's generally treated with cognitive behavior therapy and the success rates are strong. If you or someone that you know lives with depression, you might consider setting up online therapy to get them into a treatment plan to improve their symptoms of depression. What is the most common cause of depression in older adults?: The most common cause of depression in seniors is underlying chronic medical conditions, such as cancer, heart disease, or stroke. Living with these medical conditions for extended periods of time can reduce quality of life, which leads to depression. How does depression in older adults differ from depression in younger adults?: Although depression can affect anyone of any age, it presents differently in senior adults than it does in younger adults. For example, seniors are less likely to seek treatment for the cognitive-affective symptoms of depression than younger adults. Also, seniors living with depression are more likely to have poor memory and concentration, which can affect their ability to retrieve information as quickly, in addition to sleep disturbances and difficulties with psychomotor function. How does retirement affect the elderly?: Retirement can be a good thing for the elderly, as it gives them the opportunity to finally relax later on in life after all of that hard work. However, there are more and more studies revealing that retirement can be detrimental to seniors. For example, research conducted by the Institute of Economic Affairs discovered that retirement increased the chances of seniors developing some form of depression by as much as 40%. What are the psychological problems of the elderly?: The more common psychological problems of the elderly are dementia and depression, as they affect roughly 5% and 7% of seniors, respectively. They can often be confused with each other, as both depression and dementia can lead to mental decline. What is the safest antidepressant for the elderly?: For a senior living with depression, there are many antidepressants that have been shown to provide relief from major depressive episodes. Before considering any medications, please consult with your doctor or primary care physician to which option is best for you. The safest antidepressant for seniors is the family of SSRIs, known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, mostly because they work well with patients who have cardiovascular disease. Some of the more common side effects include dry mouth, agitation, insomnia, excessive sweating, nausea, and diarrhea. What age is considered old for a woman?: What is considered old by any standards is dependent on the average life expectancy age. It's different for different people in various areas of the world. For example, where the life expectancy for a woman in Sierra Leone is 72, then they would be considered old at 57. In regards to women in the United States, a woman is considered old when they get to the age of 73. However, age is just a number. Characteristic aging is something else, which is the age at which a person starts to show a decline in cognitive ability and physical function. Although a woman may be 73, they could still have a lively sense of humor and a mind as sharp as a tack. What are the signs of a nervous breakdown?: A nervous breakdown is the name given to a period of severe emotional distress. When this happens, a person is unable to function in their everyday life and may feel as though they're in immediate danger. It is not a medical term, but it has been used to describe intense episodes of stress, and can be used to refer to acute stress disorder, depression, and anxiety. Symptoms of a nervous breakdown can include insomnia, hallucinations, symptoms of anxiety and/or depression, difficulty breathing, suicidal thoughts, paranoia, and flashbacks of a traumatic event. If you or someone you love is experiencing suicidal thoughts, help is available. The 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline can be reached 24/7 by calling or texting 988 or chatting with a counselor.  Does depression make you age faster?: Living with depression won't make you physically age faster, but it will hasten the aging effect on your brain. A study conducted by Irina Esterlis at Yale School of Medicine revealed that brains dealing with severe symptoms of depression had lower synaptic density. Synaptic density refers to the amount of synapses within the brain that allows the nerves cells to transmit messages to each other. The fewer synapses, the fewer messages that are being sent around the brain. Synapses do decrease in number as a person ages, but experiencing depression can hasten this process. Can depression in the elderly mimic dementia?: For a senior person, many of the symptoms of mental disorders, including depression, can look like dementia symptoms instead, such as difficulties with memory and changes in behavior. Seeking professional help from a doctor or another healthcare provider can rule out the confusion between the two so that a correct diagnosis can be achieved. What are the negative effects of retirement? Most seniors look forward to retirement life, as it gives them the break they need from years of having a job so that they can relax in their old age. Spending time traveling, learning a new skill, taking on hobbies they didn't have time for before, doing volunteer work, or trying out a new career can give them a sense of purpose and increase life satisfaction. But there is a downside to retirement that not many retirees consider until it confronts them squarely in the face. After a few yearsâ€”or even just a few monthsâ€”retirement can lose its appeal for some. Firstly, retiring can have bad effects on health. Studies have shown that retiring led to a 5-16% increase in difficulty related to mobility-based activities, a 5-6% increase in illness conditions, and a 6-9% decline in mental health. Retiring shouldn't be an excuse to sit at home all day doing nothing. Researchers suggest that even when you retire, daily contact with friends and family should be maintained, new subjects should be explored, and creativity should be at the top of the list to keep the mind active. How do you help the elderly cope with retirement?: Whether retirement was a choice or it was forced upon an unfortunate senior, it can be a life-changing moment for those who aren't prepared for it. A person becomes accustomed to full-time work. On-site work, co-worker interaction, and the sense of purpose that come with employment become the individual's default settings. So when there is suddenly nothing to do, then they don't know what to do with themselves. The following tips may help you or a loved one who's retiring find a healthier way to transition to retirement. To help new retirees cope with retirement, encourage them to engage in activities they've never tried before or interests they haven't indulged as much as they'd like. A study published in the Canadian Journal of Aging concluded that it can be healthier for the psyche of retirees to think about retirement as a time for doing something new, as opposed to not doing anything. They could start building a new garden in their yard, try volunteer work, lend their knowledge and experience in classrooms, learn a musical instrument, or take up a relaxing sport, physical abilities allowing. If those in their later years self-identify as a guitar player or a gardener instead of a retiree, perhaps elderly living will seem more appealing and enjoyable. According to the Health and Retirement Study, retirees can see positive health effects and decreased depression after retirement when participating in leisure activities. Encouraging them to be active will also help to stave off feelings of loneliness and lack of self-worth, which can lead to depressing thoughts and anxiety, and may even help with weight loss. Follow up with them to provide encouragement and ensure they're remaining consistent. Maintaining important relationships can ensure retirees are staying social and avoiding loneliness. While not everyone who's in the process of retiring minds solitude, even those who are introverts can benefit from ensuring they remain somewhat social. According to a meta-analysis, a lack of social relationships is associated with decreased cognitive function. It is also good for retirees to have their finances in order. Talking to a financial planner can help take some of the worry out of retiring for the elderly. Many retirees even get a part-time job based on their interests, which can provide a sense of purpose. Some retirees choose to work at wine shops or health food stores, while others become medical reviewers or tutors. According to a study published in the Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, this gradual transition from full-time employment to part-time work, often called bridge employment, can be easier than transitioning directly into full-time retirement. Retirees can take advantage of relationship dynamics with co-workers and ease into the next stage of their life. When retirement planning, factoring in part-time employment may help mediate the link between retirement and depression. What happens to your brain when you retire?: What happens to the brain when you retire is dependent on what you plan on doing when you retire. If your future plans are focused on sitting in front of the television all day, then your brain isn't going to be very happy with that. Studies have shown that cognitive function declines when a person retires, simply because they give themselves nothing to do. Just like internet cookies (the ones that are always labeled ""cookies, settings, reject""), the brain can continue collecting data after an individual has moved on from what they were doing. But the brain can continue to thrive if you remain active during your retirement years. Learning new skills and crafts, engaging in hobbies that you enjoy, and staying physically active will keep both the mind and the body feeling healthy and at their best, no matter what age you are. What is the most common psychiatric disorder in the elderly?: Roughly 20% of seniors report having a mental health concern; the most common conditions affecting seniors are anxiety, cognitive impairment, depression, and bipolar disorder. Anxiety disorder was prevalent among 15.3% of seniors aged 60 or older, due to both external and internal factors. External factors that can create anxiety in a senior include chronic illnesses, disability, or the major illness of a spouse, while internal factors include poor self-perception of health, increased loneliness, and reduced physical activity. If you believe that you are experiencing any of these symptoms, then please text HOME to 741741 now. What are the most common psychiatric illnesses in the elderly?: There are four main psychiatric illnesses that affect the elderly: depression, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorders, and eating disorders. Depression is one of the most pervasive mental health concerns that can be difficult to diagnose in seniors. That is because the more common signs, such as increased sleep and lower energy levels are often misinterpreted as just being part of the aging process. Anxiety disorders are also misdiagnosed in seniors because they tend to focus on the physical problems they experience and ignore the psychiatric symptoms. Anxiety is most likely to occur in seniors who have general feelings of poor health, experience traumatic events such as the death of a spouse, have chronic physical symptoms, or have physical impairments that limit their daily functioning. Bipolar disorders are indicated by large mood swings from one extreme to the other. Called manic and depressive episodes, a senior can experience a state of heightened energy and then an immediate plummet into having no energy at all. In seniors especially, this can lead to a sense of confusion, agitation, and loss of judgment and perception. Eating disorders can affect seniors quite easily, especially if there are underlying psychological issues that go undetected. These include changes in smell and taste, cognitive impairment, depression, or other physical ailments they may be living with. If you are experiencing symptoms of an eating disorder such as anorexia or bulimia, please call the National Eating Disorder Association Helpline at 1-800-931-2237. What are the four major old age problems?: When it comes to old age, there are four major problems that seniors tend to worry about. Firstly, chronic health conditions plague 92% of seniors such as stroke, cancer, heart disease, or diabetes. Secondly is cognitive health. Over time, the brain tends to slow down, making it difficult to recall things that were once easy. The most common cognitive health concern that seniors face is dementia. The third concern is mental well-being. According to WHO, over 15% of adults aged 60 and over live with a mental disorder of some kind. The most common kind is depression, which can sometimes go undiagnosed or untreated. Lastly is physical injury. The human body can start to decline in its reflexes and stability due to loss of muscle mass and bone density, leading a senior to be more prone to falls.

Managing Depression: Can I Do It On My Own?,BetterHelp,"When a lot is weighing on your mind, you might fall asleep feeling sad and wake up in the morning and still feel sad. This is probably nothing to worry about if that happens once in a while. If it's happening nearly every day over a long period, though, you might be dealing with something more than ordinary sadness. It could be that you have clinical depression. Hearing the word depression can be tough if you're not familiar with what it truly means. In general, society has a lot of misperceptions about depression and other mental health disorders. It's common for people to attach a stigma to mental health conditions. There Is No Shame In Seeking Help When You Feel DepressedOur Expert Therapists Are Here For You While depression is a common mental health disorder, it is essential to take it seriously and address it. The psychological community has assigned criteria to help diagnose depression. While it's important to learn as much as you can about depression, you shouldn't try to diagnose yourself. If your sadness seems like it's getting out of control, it's best to talk to a licensed clinician so you can get a clear diagnosis and decide on a treatment plan. What Are The Symptoms Of Depression? Several factors have to be considered for people with depression when trying to make a distinction between normal sadness and a diagnosis of clinical depression, which is why it's important to get a clinical assessment from a licensed clinician. The criteria for a diagnosis for depression are listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5). The criteria state that someone must have five or more of the following symptoms during the same two-week period, and at least one of them should either fall into the category of depressed mood or loss of interest.  Having a depressed mood the greater part of the day on most days. Having less interest or pleasure in most activities most of the day. Having significant weight gain or weight loss that can't be explained. Having sluggish thoughts or movements, as noticed by others. Feeling fatigued and having less energy nearly every day. Feelings of worthlessness and guilt almost every day. Decreased ability to think and make decisions almost every day. Having recurrent thoughts about death or have suicidal ideations or attempts.  A licensed mental health provider is qualified to assess whether these symptoms cause a person significant distress or impairment in social, work, or other important areas of functioning. The criteria also state that symptoms should not be a result of substance use disorder or another medical condition. If you or a loved one are experiencing suicidal thoughts, reach out for help immediately. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline can be reached at 1-800-273-8255, and is available 24/7.  Facing Your Fears About Getting Professional Help Often times, people are afraid to get professional help even when they know that they have a problem that they can't deal with successfully on their own. Fear of the unknown prevents a lot of people from seeking help. A couple of things can help someone to get over the fear of getting help for a mental health issue. The first thing to consider in confronting your fears is that you aren't alone. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), about one in five people have some type of mental illness. About 16 million adults in America live with major depression. When you finally schedule an appointment with a licensed mental health provider, don't be alarmed if you feel a little anxious at first. For some people, the act of making the appointment means having to admit to themselves that they may have a mental health condition, and they need professional help. It can be intimidating to think that you might be labeled with a mental illness when you don't know much about the diagnosis or treatment options. It helps to think about mental health in much the same way that you think about physical health. We all have mental health. Sometimes our mental health is in good shape, and sometimes we need a little treatment to improve it. Clinical professionals are highly trained in their professions, just as medical doctors are. They're the experts in their field, and they can help you fight depression and educate you about depression treatment. The second thing to consider is that there are many options for depression treatment and stress management. Your chances of improving your symptoms of depression are good. What Can I Expect If I Work With A Therapist? Once you get past the fear of accepting treatment for your depression symptoms, you'll probably find that you start to look forward to your therapy sessions. During the first few sessions, your therapist will help you try to relax. They'll establish a professional working relationship with you, and you'll both begin to build trust. Your therapist will also take a medical and personal history. You'll need to disclose if you're taking any medications for any other medical conditions. If you know of other family members that have a formal or informal diagnosis of depression, your therapist should know this as well. Therapists will also usually do some type of testing, but that's cause for worry. Testing is usually non-invasive. Most often, you'll be asked to fill out some questionnaires or rating scales about the types of symptoms you're having and their intensity. There Is No Shame In Seeking Help When You Feel DepressedOur Expert Therapists Are Here For You Once your therapist has given you a diagnosis, they will discuss it with you and help you learn more about it. Once you have a firm diagnosis, your therapist can talk to you about the potential treatment options and help you to set goals. When you've met your treatment goals, you may be able to end your therapy sessions. More often than not, your therapist will give you an idea of how long your sessions will run and give you some idea of how long your treatment program will last. Do I Need To Work With A Therapist Or Can I Do It On My Own? You may be inclined to try to work through your depression on your own. That said, there are many benefits to working with a qualified therapist. A therapist can let you know whether your symptoms meet the clinical criteria for mental illness. Also, they are the best people to help you understand how your brain is working and what you can do to help it work better. Also, they'll be able to go over all the possible treatment options with you and help you to choose the ones that you're willing to try. Remember that your therapy sessions won't be forever. You and your therapist can jointly decide when you've successfully reached your treatment goals. You'll have a pretty good idea of whether you can take what you've learned and managed on your own. Your treatment plan may include some exercises for stress management. Don't worry, if your symptoms reappear or worsen, you can always restart your sessions. Alternative Treatments For Depression And Stress Management The most common treatment for depression is therapy. For very serious cases of depression, a person may also get some relief by taking medication. Your therapist can help you to make a decision on whether you need medication. Many people find that their depression symptoms improve with regular therapy and by using stress management techniques in between appointments. Experiencing feelings of depression can make you feel helpless. It doesn't always take much to start turning around those negative thoughts. Sometimes all that it takes is adding in some physical activity, changing your lifestyle, or working on improving your way of thinking. Some things to consider when trying to manage your depression and stress on your own are doing them regularly and tracking your moods so that you'll know when you've made progress. A lot of the things that you can do to improve our mental health and well-being are things that you know that you should be doing and have put them on the back burner. When addressing your symptoms of depression, it's important to make your overall health a priority. Here is a list of basic things that you can do to get started:  Establish a daily routine and stick with it. Set some goals for yourself every day, even if they're small and attainable at first. Build time into your schedule every day for some exercise. Eat a healthy, well-balanced diet. Go to sleep and get up at the same time every day. Consider doing some volunteer work to give you a purpose and help you feel accomplished. Do your best to replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts.  These tips aren't a cure-all, but they can work in tandem with therapy and with each other to help you improve your symptoms of depression. Many people find that online therapy works nicely for them because it's convenient, and they're more comfortable receiving services in their homes.  Overall, you may be able to manage depression on your own, but you're apt to have faster and better success when you work with a licensed therapist who is trained in treating depression.

What Should I Know About DSM V Depression?,BetterHelp,"DSM and depression are associated with one another, but they're two very different things. Depression is a serious medical condition, while the DSM is a handbook that serves as an authoritative guide for diagnosing mental health disorders.  Managing Depression Starts With Small StepsBegin Your Healing Journey With Therapy Diagnostic Criteria For Depression According To the DSM-5Depression is a mental health disorder that may also be called a major depressive disorder or clinical depression. While depression is a mental health disorder, it can also cause physical symptoms like chronic pain or digestive issues. Depression manifests a bit differently in everyone, even though many of their symptoms may be the same. In some people, depression is fairly mild, and in others, it can be quite serious. Depending on the circumstances that brought the depression on, it can be temporary, or it can be persistent. What Is The DSM? DSM is an acronym for The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), which is published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). Healthcare providers in the United States, and somewhat in the world, rely on the DSM as an authoritative guide on diagnosing mental health disorders. Clinicians will find descriptions of mental health disorders, along with symptoms and other criteria to assist them in making qualified diagnoses. The other benefit to the DSM is that it uses common language for clinicians to use with their patients and with other clinicians, which provides consistency in diagnostics and research. Using a common language also helps pharmaceutical companies in the development of medications and other interventions. I'm Struggling With Sadness, Do I Have Depression? Everyone goes through periods of sadness for various lengths of time. If you consider that the main symptom of depression is sadness, it can be difficult to differentiate the difference between normal periods of sadness and depression that requires some type of clinical intervention. Sadness is a healthy emotion that all people experience at one time or another. It's common to feel sadness as a result of a situation, event, or person. When you lose a job, end a relationship, get a diagnosis of serious physical disease or ailment, or hear of a loved one's passing, you're bound to be sad for some time. When we contrast normal periods of sadness with depression, there's no situation, event, or person that triggers depression. You should be able to feel happiness and joy when good things are happening in your life. You might feel frustrated, upset, or disappointed at times, but you should still be able to enjoy watching television, playing video games, reading, or doing other favorite activities. Normal periods of sadness won't usually keep you up at night. It won't prevent you from going to work in the morning. You'll probably still feel like eating. In your interactions with friends, family, or coworkers, you might feel regret your words or actions, and you might wish you could have a ""do-over,"" but it won't cause you to feel major guilt or worthlessness. If you're feeling sad and hopeless about everything, even when you can't attribute it to anything specific, you may have a depressive disorder. If you have a major depressive disorder, you lose interest in the activities that you used to enjoy. You may not feel like eating, and you might be sleeping too much or too little. A depressive disorder may cause you to have negative thought patterns about yourself and everyone else. Depression isn't just a strong degree of sadness. It has to do with a combination of factors that relate to the duration of negative feelings, the impact they have on your body, other symptoms, and the effect that depressive symptoms have on your ability to manage normal, everyday functions. One of the most important differences between general sadness and a depressive disorder is that people with a major depressive disorder may have suicidal ideations or feelings about harming themselves or others that are difficult for them to shake off. Diagnosing A Major Depressive Disorder During Times Of Loss Or Hardship Diagnosing a depressive disorder becomes even more complicated when someone experiences a significant loss in addition to have persistent feelings of sadness. If this sounds like you or someone that you know, don't try to make a diagnosis on your own and don't ignore it. This type of situation calls for getting the opinion of a licensed clinician or other mental health professional.    When you visit a mental health professional, they take a medical and mental health history from you. They will ask you a lot of questions, and they may ask you to fill out one or more questionnaires. Once they've done their due diligence in information gathering, they'll compare the information with the criteria for major depressive disorder as provided by the American Psychiatric Association in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders before making a diagnosis of a depressive disorder or something else. The DSM-5 is the latest version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. According to this guide, individuals must experience five or more of the following symptoms during the same two-week period, and the symptoms should either be related to a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure:  Experiencing a depressed mood almost every day for most of the day. Having a noticeable decreased interest or pleasure in all or almost all activities that you formerly enjoyed almost every day. Having a significant weight gain or loss when not consciously trying to lose or gain weight or having a noticeable decrease or increase in appetite. Feeling like your thoughts are sluggish and having slower physical movements. Feeling fatigued or loss of energy almost every day. Having feelings of worthlessness, excessive guilt, or misdirected guilt almost every day. Difficulty being able to think, concentrate or focus almost every day. Having recurrent thoughts of death, having recurrent suicidal ideations, having a plan for committing suicide, or attempting suicide.  If you or someone that you know is experiencing the symptoms as described in the final bullet point, it's important to seek emergency help. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline 1-800-273-8255 and is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. In the latest version of the DSM-5, the APA added two more specifications to help further classify diagnoses.  Depression With Mixed Features. This means that for patients that don't meet the full criteria for a manic episode, clinicians can allow for the presence of manic symptoms as part of their diagnosis for depression. Depression With Anxious Stress. Clinicians should perform an assessment of anxious distress as part of their assessment for depression and determine whether it warrants any changes in their prognosis, treatment options, or patient's response to them.  What Are the Signs And Symptoms Of Clinical Depression? No one is immune to the symptoms of clinical depression. It can strike anyone at any time, across genders, ethnicities, socioeconomic statuses, and other demographics. For a clinician to accurately diagnose clinical depression, the symptoms of depression must be severe enough to cause disruption in their work, school, social life, or daily activities, and they shouldn't be caused by substance abuse or some other medical condition. Managing Depression Starts With Small StepsBegin Your Healing Journey With Therapy Here are some of the questions a licensed clinician may ask to determine a diagnosis of clinical depression. Some of these are also listed under the criteria for the DSM-5.  Feeling sad, teary-eyed, empty or hopeless Having angry outbursts, or expressing irritability or frustration over little things Losing interest or pleasure in most or all normal activities like sex, sports, or hobbies Sleeping far too much or far too little Being tired, lacking energy Extreme weight loss or weight gain or big changes in appetite Feeling anxious, agitated, or restless Experiencing slowed speech or body movements Feeling guilty, worthless, or fixating on past failures Having difficulty thinking, concentrating and making decisions Frequent or consistent thoughts of suicide or death Physical problems like back pain or headaches that can't be explained  Suicide Associated With Major Depression According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the majority of people that have depression die due to a cause other than suicide. While that's good news, people that have a diagnosis of depression have an increased risk of suicide when compared with people that don't live with depression. In some cases, the risk of death by suicide may be related to the severity of the depression. HHS has new data that shows that about 2% of the people that have been treated for depression in an outpatient setting will die by suicide. The rate for people living with depression that have been treated in an inpatient hospital setting is higher at 4%. Patients that were treated for depression on an in-patient basis following incidents of having suicidal ideations or suicide attempts are three times more likely (6%) to die by suicide as those who were treated in outpatient settings. HHS also reports that there are significant differences in the risk of suicide connected with depression based on differences in gender. The rate for men with a lifetime history of depression that die by suicide is 7% as compared with only 1% of women that have a lifetime history of depression that die due to suicide. As mentioned above, if you or someone you know are suicidal, you should seek immediate help. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is available at 1-800-273-8255 and is reachable 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Clinical depression is a serious medical condition. If you suspect that you or someone that you care about has uncontrolled depression, it helps to schedule an appointment with a licensed therapist. Treatments for depression are usually quite effective. The sooner you seek help, the sooner you can begin to enjoy life again. Remember that no matter what you're experiencing, with the right tools, you can move forward in healthy ways.   ",2022-09-01,Education
Is There A Cure For Depression?,BetterHelp,"When you have depression, it can be easy to feel helpless and hopeless â€“ after all, those are symptoms. You may be wondering, is there a cure for depression? Here's some hope and help for you: There are multiple cures for depression! You May Be Wondering If There Is A Cure For DepressionTherapy Offers A Variety Of Options Depression can be caused by several different things, so the cure for your depression will probably lie in what's causing your depression. It will also depend on who you are as a person. In fact, some people respond best to combinations of cures. The first step to understanding the best option for you is understanding what options are out there. What Causes Depression? Understanding what cures are right for you requires knowing what is causing your depression. There are a couple of things that could cause your depression. Remember, any one of these factors may be at play in your life, but for many people, a combination of two or more of these factors are causing depression. Your Genes And Natural Brain Chemistry It's unfortunate but true: some of us are likely to experience depression simply because we were born that way. Scientists don't fully understand how, but genes do seem to play a role in depression for most people. It has to do with brain chemistry. Your brain communicates with itself and with the rest of your body through a series of chemical messengers called neurotransmitters. If your body doesn't make enough of one of these chemicals, makes too much of another, or doesn't have the right balance of receptors, it can cause or contribute to depression. Substance Use The balance of neurotransmitters in your brain can also be damaged by substance use. This can form a vicious cycle in which individuals experience depression, overuse substances like alcohol, and then see that substance leads to worsening depression. Life Changes For many people, depression is brought on by lifestyle changes, like moving to a new place, losing a loved one, or even losing a job. This is called ""adjustment disorder."" Some people adjust to the new situation, while for other people it's more complicated. Women can also experience depression related to hormone challenges at various stages of their lives, and may develop a potentially severe form of depression after giving birth called ""postpartum depression."" New research shows that postpartum depression can affect new fathers, too. Unmet Needs Mental Health Researcher Johann Hari is an advocate for looking at depression as a social health disorder rather than a mental or emotional health disorder. While it's easy to dismiss depression as a chemical imbalance, that's also dismissive.  Your depression may be caused at least in part by chemical imbalances in your brain, but they may also be caused by unmet needs. Do you have a job or pastimes that are meaningful to you? Do you have close relationships with friends and family? It could be that your depression is less a medical concern and more a social concern. But we'll get back to this when we get into the cures. Combinations Of The Above A theme throughout this article has been and will continue to be that depression is often more complicated than a simple ""X caused my depression."" For many people, a combination of more than one of the above situations can cause depression. For example, a woman may have a natural predisposition to depression that doesn't cause problems until it is ""triggered"" by hormonal changes due to lifestyle changes that together create a problem. Similarly, someone may undergo a difficult experience and explore substance use, which gets out of hand and aggravates their depression as well as helping it to stick around longer than it otherwise would have. Cures For Depression Now that we have a better understanding of the causes let's take a look at some of the causes and which one might be right for you or the person in your life experiencing depression. Talk Therapy Talk therapies are what you may think about when you think about therapy for depression and other mental health conditions. An individual meets with a therapist/counselor or a group of other people with experience with their condition to talk about their feelings and how they can manage their emotions during difficult times. Talk therapies are highly effective for people dealing with depression that doesn't have a biological component. For example, if you're dealing with depression because you lost your job, but you don't have problems with your brain chemistry, contributing to your depression, talk therapy might be enough for you. That having been said, even if your depression is caused by biological causes, talk therapy can still help you to manage your emotional symptoms. In fact, while some people do use talk-therapy essentially for their entire lives, other people can get what they need from talk therapy and then using those tools on their own from then on. Medication Medications for depression work by altering your brain chemistry back towards a healthy balance. Different medications work in different ways, but some of the most common options work by preventing your body from reabsorbing neurotransmitters so that the brain has more time to use them. You May Be Wondering If There Is A Cure For DepressionTherapy Offers A Variety Of Options This means that modern antidepressants are far less likely to be habit-forming or addictive than earlier antidepressants that simply increased the volume of feel-good neurotransmitters. While well-intentioned, these earlier generations could cause receptors in the brain to burn out, causing further problems. Substance Counseling Unfortunately for people with depression and substance abuse problems, most illicit substances â€“ including alcohol â€“ can have dangerous interactions with common antidepressant medications. That means that people with substance use problems need to quit using those substances before getting medication for their depression. That often means undergoing substance abuse counseling to help them to drop their substance use as quickly as they safely can. Mixed Approaches As we've seen, for most people with depression, that depression isn't caused by just one cause. That means that multiple approaches are often the most effective. For people with clinical depression, medication may be enough, but they see the most improvement in the shortest time if they also undergo talk therapies. Similarly, substance abuse counseling almost always includes â€“ or at least offers â€“ some form of talk therapy to help the individuals manage their depression. At the same time, they quit their substance use so that they can get medication if necessary. Determining What Cures Are Right For You So, now we've looked at causes for depression and causes that might work for you. So, which ones are right for you? In most cases, this is really a question of knowing who to talk to. For some of the cases, particularly for women regarding things like lifestyle changes, the good news is that you should already be talking with your healthcare provider, and they should know to watch out for depression at these stages in your life. Medication requires a diagnosis, which means working with your healthcare provider. The same is true for formalized substance abuse counseling. However, community-based solutions like alcoholics anonymous and narcotics anonymous can both be engaged in without prescription. Technically, anyone can access talk therapies with a licensed and professional counselor or therapist. However, there are many obstacles potentially standing in the way. For one, many communities, particularly rural communities, don't have easy access to counselors and therapists in their area. Other people may have access but may not want to see a therapist or counselor in their area because of the stigma that is often associated with mental health issues â€“ again, particularly in rural communities. Further, counselors and therapists are notoriously expensive. For most people, they only become affordable with the help of insurance plans, and most insurance plans that cover counseling require a diagnosis. Exploring Telehealth Solutions All of the obstacles to seeing a counselor or therapist in person, particularly without a prescription, can be overcome through telehealth. In mental health, telehealth involves using a secure internet connection to meet with a licensed and professional therapist or counselor through video or voice calls and private chatrooms. These platforms are more flexible for busy schedules. They're more affordable for people that don't have insurance that covers talk therapy or that are waiting on a diagnosis. They're more accessible for people that don't have access to a counselor or therapist in their community, and they're more private for people that do have access to a counselor or therapist in their area but would prefer not to see them.

There Are Cures For Depression When you have depression, it can be easy to feel like there is no cure. However, there is a cure. There are lots of effective treatments available. The first step is discovering what cure or combination of cures is right for you. This can be its own journey involving looking at your needs, but it is also a journey that you should be going on with your care providers. They can help you to understand the causes of your depression, pick the best solution, and help you to get advanced systems of care when you need them.

"Depression In the Elderly: Causes, Symptoms, And Precautions",BetterHelp,"Depression can impact anyone at any age. However, at different stages of life, it can be caused by different things and can manifest in different ways. As a result, if you are worried about depression in yourself or someone that you care about, it can be helpful to look within the context of their unique situation. The Elderly Can Have An Increased Chance Of Feeling DepressedTherapy Can Reduce The Risk Of Depression Common Depression Causes And Symptoms That Impact The Elderly Here, we'll be looking at causes, symptoms of depression, specifically in the elderly. We'll also look at things that you can do to make elderly depression less likely because depression is not a healthy normal part of growing older. Before we get into specific causes and symptoms that are more likely to impact the elderly, let's take a quick moment to talk about depressions and symptoms that are common to depression in general. Remember, individuals probably won't exhibit all of the symptoms of depression, and depression can be caused by multiple circumstances working together. It's always dangerous to look at lists of symptoms and causes and think, ""None of these situations exactly describe X, so X must not have depression."" If you're uncertain about whether or not you have depression, talk to your primary care provider. Your primary care provider can help you determine whether you have depression and help you to navigate the best treatment method for your case. Common Causes The three main causes of depression in older people, as well as in everyone else, are life events, biological circumstances, and combinations of the two. Your mood is largely the result of chemical messengers in your brain. When something happens that offsets the balance of these chemical messengers, it can lead to or worsen depression. Of course, your mood is also the result of your life events. Difficult life events like the loss of a loved one, loss of a job, or moving to a new place can also cause or worsen depression. Finally, for most people who develop lasting depression, a combination of the above two events are what does it. Genetic predisposition or changing brain chemistry due to aging and difficult life events may not have been enough to cause depression, but if these two things happen at the same time, it can have a mounting effect. Depression can manifest differently in different people. You may notice yourself or the individual that you're worried about ""acting different"" or ""feeling different"" without manifesting any of these symptoms. Sometimes it can be best to trust your gut. Even if it isn't depression, it could be something else worth keeping an eye on. Common Symptoms The most common symptom of depression is ""feeling down."" This could be a depressed mood, low energy, or both. We all feel a little down sometimes, but in this context, we're talking about feelings that prevent the individual from engaging in activities that they once enjoyed, meeting commitments, or even taking care of themselves. Sometimes this feeling takes the form of feelings of hopelessness. Other times, it can just be a lack of interest, particularly in things that are important or that the person once particularly enjoyed. For these symptoms to contribute to a formal diagnosis of depression, they usually have to be felt for often than not more days than not for at least a few weeks. Less common but more alarming signs of depression include thoughts of suicide and increase or ""obsessive"" thought of suicide and death. While some people will try to keep these thoughts to themselves, some people are surprisingly vocal about them. If you or someone you know is experiencing suicidal thoughts, help is available. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline can be reached at 1-800-273-8255 and is available 24/7, or you can text the word ""HOME"" to 741741 to reach the Crisis Text Line. Causes Unique To The Elderly The causes of depression that we discussed above can all impact the elderly. However, there are a couple of specific causes that are more likely to impact older people. Isolation Humans are social beings, and feeling like you have strong connections to people that you care about is important to your health. So older people, who often live alone or may live with others but away from family as in the case of assisted living communities, may feel isolation contributing to feelings of depression. Medication As mentioned above, the balance of brain chemicals can contribute to depression. Some medications can alter this balance leading to depression as an unfortunate side effect. Because older adults are often more medications than younger people, they are more likely to experience these complications. The good news is that the side effects of most medications and combinations of medications are fairly well understood. So, if you're experiencing symptoms of depression that you think might be related to your medication, let your primary care provider know right away.  While younger people may not realize it, advanced age can be a very dynamic time of life. Older adults might be experiencing changes in their careers, they might be moving out of houses and into apartments or senior living communities. They may even be losing friends and family members or facing the prospect of their own delicate health. Life Changes Any of these changes could be a challenge for anyone, but in later life, they can be particularly destabilizing, particularly if they happen nearby. Symptoms Unique To The Elderly As mentioned above, the symptoms of depression in older adults are by-and-large the same as symptoms of depression in the general population. However, there are a few that might be more noticeable and/or more significant in the elderly. Withdrawing Withdrawing can be a vicious circle when it comes to depression, particularly in the elderly. As mentioned above, a lack of interest can be a symptom of depression. This can lead people to stop reaching out socially. Also, as mentioned above, isolation can be a cause of depression. In this way, depression can actually act to worsen itself through this kind of feedback mechanism. Imagined And Real Physical Symptoms Physical symptoms, including difficulty sleeping and unexplained weight loss, can be present in depression at any age. However, they are more likely to be present in older adults with depression. Some older adults with depression also believe in having adverse physical conditions that they don't. A recurring theme throughout this article is that the best thing to do, whether you think that you have depression or not, is to maintain a good relationship with your primary care providers. They can help you to navigate the space between symptoms of depression, symptoms of physical conditions, and everything in between. Thoughts Of Death Or Suicide We often think of thoughts of suicide as a symptom of major depression. However, in the elderly, thoughts of death may be a more likely indicator. Thoughts of suicide are dangerous less because it is a sign of depression, and more because suicide is a thing that a person can actively do. If you are having thoughts of suicide that alarm you, reach out online at www.crisistextline.com or by calling 1-800-273-8255. If you or someone you know is experiencing suicidal thoughts, help is available. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline can be reached at 1-800-273-8255 and is available 24/7, or you can text the word ""HOME"" to 741741 to reach the Crisis Text Line. Thoughts of death, on the other hand, are more alarming because they are a symptom of depression than because they are dangerous in and of themselves in the same way that thoughts of suicide can be. Because death is a natural part of life in a way, that suicide is not, it is normal and even healthy for people â€“ particularly older people â€“ to think about death. It becomes a symptom when thoughts of death become obsessive. The Elderly Can Have An Increased Chance Of Feeling DepressedTherapy Can Reduce The Risk Of Depression While some of the factors that can cause depression are a natural part of life, depression is not a normal part of aging. There are things that you can do, as an older adult or as a friend/family member/caregiver to an older adult, to prevent or ease elder depression.Precautions Against Elder Depression As A Supporter If you're a friend, family member, or caregiver worried about depression in an older adult that is close to you, there are some things that you can do to help to prevent or ease depression for that person. The first is to maintain close relationships with those people, in-person when possible. Talk to them, visit them. Listen to them, but don't patronize them because you're worried about them. This can, itself, help to prevent or lessen depression in that individual, but it can also help you to notice symptoms early if they do start to manifest. The next is to make sure that they have what they need to be happy and healthy. Make sure that they have transportation to things that they want to do, like social events, as well as to things that they need to do like doctor visits. As An Older Adult If you're an older adult worried about depression, there are a number of things that you can do on your own to help you to prevent or lessen depression. Make sure to keep doing things that you enjoy. If that's difficult because of health issues or limited mobility, try to find new activities that are easier for you to do. The first is to maintain social relationships. That means with your family if possible but also with friends. It also means, once again, to maintain relationships with your healthcare providers. This may not make you feel better at an emotional level, but it can help you to manage the physical conditions that can cause or contribute to depression. On the other hand, if you spend a lot of time worrying about your physical health, working with your primary care provider may help you feel better on an emotional level. Finally, you may want to talk to a mental health specialist. Mental health specialists like counselors and therapists can help you if you do have depression, but they can also help you to navigate through difficult emotions more healthily. Even if you can afford to talk to a therapist or counselor, whether on your own or through your healthcare provider, getting to them can be difficult, and you may want access to the outside of meetings. While this is difficult to manage with an in-person counselor or therapist, it can be easier with the help of telehealth platforms like BetterHelp. Moving Forward Hopefully, this article has helped you to understand how to look at symptoms of depression in older adults. Hopefully, it has also helped you to understand what can do to prevent or lessen depression in yourself or someone you care about.",2022-08-15,Special Groups
How Depression Symptoms In Women Are Different From Depression Symptoms In Men,BetterHelp,"In many cases, mental health can be analogous to physical health. Most people share common physical health traits and conditions, but factors such as age or biological sex can change how they manifest. For example, let's look at heart attacks: Depression Can Impact Anyone, Regardless Of Age, Race, Or GenderTherapists Make It Easier For Everyone Physically, men and women can both get heart attacks. The basic effect is the same, but men and women can experience different symptoms. Further, general society has historically tended to be more familiar with the heart attack symptoms for men than those for women. This has placed women at a serious disadvantage when seeking treatment, though attitudes and mental frameworks have started to change to become more equitable in recent years. Depression is very similar. Women and men can share similar mental, physical, and emotional effects of depression â€“ but the symptoms can be different.  Not only that, but there are also mental health conditions related to the kind of depression we are familiar with which only impact women, or which impact women statistically more often. Understanding how symptoms of depression in women are different from symptoms of depression in men can save lives. Common Symptoms of Depression Please keep in mind that feelings of sadness, especially during hard times in life, are normal. Those living with depression face more than sadness. Depression refers specifically to a diagnosable and treatable mental health condition when a persistent negative feeling is severe and prolonged. Further, there are a lot of symptoms associated with depression, and not every individual experiences all of them. For the most part, symptoms of depression in women are largely similar to the symptoms that are similar in men. But these symptoms become increasingly important in specific contexts that apply exclusively to women. Loss of Interest and Low Energy Perhaps the most recognizable symptom of depression is a loss of interest. This is when an individual experiences disinterest in or even aversion to activities that they once enjoyed or that were otherwise important to them. Some people, regardless of what they want to do or feel that they have to do, may feel a lack of physical, emotional, or mental energy that prevents them from engaging in various activities. As a symptom of depression, this condition is typically persistent and long-term. There are times when you may prefer a quiet movie to hanging out with your friends. You may also have moments of wanting to sleep more in bed than going to work. These feelings are very normal. But a symptom of depression may include feeling unable to work for a long time due to a lack of energy or motivation, or closing off your social networks if you feel like you're unable to maintain them adequately. It is important to differentiate normal feelings from potential symptoms of depression, and even more critical to reach out to mental health professionals if you seek advice or guidance. Health and Lifestyle Changes Depression is a mental health concern, but it has physical symptoms as well. Significant examples are maintaining a healthy weight and healthy sleep habits. Some people may experience loss of interest and low energy, or spend a lot of time sleeping. Others have difficulty sleeping and don't get rest at all, contributing to their low energy. Similarly, some people experiencing symptoms of depression don't feel the energy to make healthy foods and gain weight. Others experience loss of appetite and lose weight. Do be aware, however, that eating disorders are a mental health condition related to depression. While some men do experience eating disorders, researchers believe that it is roughly twice as common in women. Communication Finally, listen to someone â€“ or yourself â€“ if you're monitoring potential symptoms of depression. People experiencing depression sometimes communicate it. They'll say that they're feeling depressed, feeling hopeless or helpless, or even that they're thinking about harming themselves. Women tend to have large and strong social networks, so they are more likely to communicate their feelings. But this does not mean that men cannot or do not communicate similar feelings; they may communicate their feelings at a lesser rate compared to women. Common Signs of Depression in Men While some signs of depression are similar in men and women, the National Institute of Mental Health have listed some signs and symptoms of depression that are more common in men:  Anger, irritability, or aggressiveness Feeling anxious, restless, or ""on edge"" Loss of interest in work, family, or once-pleasurable activities Problems with sexual desire and performance Feeling sad, ""empty,"" flat, or hopeless Not being able to concentrate or remember details Feeling very tired, not being able to sleep, or sleeping too much Overeating or not wanting to eat at all Physical aches or pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems Inability to meet the responsibilities of work, caring for family, or other important activities Engaging in high-risk activities A need for alcohol or drugs Withdrawing from family and friends or becoming isolated  Symptoms can vary from few to many for different men experiencing depression. Common Causes of Depression in Women Above we looked at symptoms of depression, particularly how they relate to women and men. However, some causes of depression aren't just more prevalent among women â€“ they're unique to women. In many cases, this is because of biological events in a woman's life that can disrupt the balance of hormones and neurotransmitters that contribute to emotional health.  Depending on other factors, this can be both unfair and advantageous for women. Most care providers, like primary care doctors, are more than familiar with the cases discussed below. Reaching out to these professionals can help find access to physical and mental health resources tailored for women. Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder You may be familiar with PMS. While it can be uncomfortable, it's not necessarily dangerous or threatening in the physical sense. However, for some women, PMS can become PMDD â€“ that's Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder. This form of PMS is severe and leads to depressive symptoms that are long-lasting and more severe than those that are already associated with that time of the month. Other than spikes around your period, this disorder doesn't have any of its own unique symptoms. Postpartum Depression Researchers believe that postpartum depression impacts as much as 20% of women. This is a kind of depression that affects mothers in the period immediately following birth. However, new research shows that postpartum depression can also affect new fathers. For the most part, symptoms of postpartum depression are the same as symptoms of standard depression that were discussed above. However, there are a couple of more telling symptoms. These include the inability to bond with the child, or thoughts of harming the child. Menopausal Depression Most people are likely to undergo menopause, but there are many who don't for many reasons. Menopause will be a change, but it's not necessarily a severe physical problem. However, for some people, menopause leads to longer and more severe complications, including depression. As we saw with PMDD, timing is the only symptom that menopausal depression has to set it apart from other depressive disorders. This is somewhat complicated by the fact that many people of this age are beginning to experience depression related to other, more social-related factors that can become significant at this age. This is another reason that maintaining a relationship with your primary care providers is so important. What to Do Now that we've looked at the situations and symptoms of depression in women, what do you do when you see them? Talk to Your Care Provider We can't stress this enough. Maintaining a relationship with your primary care provider, specifically during the lifestyle and stage-of-life changes that we've discussed here, is very important. This relationship can help your provider establish a rapport with you. You may feel more comfortable bringing your concerns and thoughts to your provider. Your provider may even notice early signs of mental health concerns and help you find the care you need. Talk to Other People Talking to your primary care provider is important, but maintaining healthy relationships with your family and friends is also important for many reasons. For one thing, healthy social networks help to prevent depression from coming on in the first place. Further, as has been a trend throughout this article, being close to people can make it more likely that people other than yourself will notice when your mental health is changing before it becomes a problem. Take A Look at Your Lifestyle We've seen that depression and other mental health concerns can negatively impact your sleep and eating habits. However, the opposite is also true. If your sleep hygiene, your diet, and your physical activity fall by the wayside, it can contribute to feelings of depression. So, maintaining a well-balanced diet, trying to get good sleep, and spending time actively and outdoors when weather permits can help to keep depression at bay. Further, if doing all of these things is something that you actively try to do but you can't keep up with them anymore, that can point to a symptom you may want to bring up to a mental health professional or care provider. When to Get Help Throughout this article, we've outlined the benefits of forming strong support networks. Trusted individuals in these networks may be able to notice potential signs of mental health issues and help start the conversation. But what if they don't? Other people can help you to notice when something's off, but they cannot read your mind or truly know your thought processes. If you feel like something is off, give yourself space and room to evaluate your situation. Know that you can seek guidance and information even if you feel if it's not too serious. If you have a low mood or low energy that prevents you from enjoying people or activities, or that gets in the way at work or with your family obligations, it may be helpful to talk to a care provider.

What Is Major Depression Disorder?,BetterHelp,"Depression can mean a lot of things. When most of us talk about depression, we're talking about a feeling â€“ an emotion that everyone gets from time to time. While it isn't comfortable to experience feelings of depression, it's also not dangerous for most people. Depression Can Disguise Itself As Many Other IssuesTherapists Can Help To Identify Depression Here, we'll talk about some of the most common and severe depressive disorders, including symptoms and how to get help. However, ""depression"" is also a class of mental health disorders. People experiencing these disorders experience feelings and even physical symptoms of depression for inordinate periods that prevent them from living healthy lives. Common Symptoms Major Depressive Disorder is its own disorder. However, other major depressive disorders have their own differences in terms of causes, symptoms, and treatments. However, all of these disorders have symptoms that are common to them. In most of the articles about depression on this site, we'll point out that these symptoms have to stick around for a while for a diagnosis. While that's still true in the case of major depressive disorders, specifics like when the symptoms manifest and how long they stick around for can be criteria of specific disorders, so we'll talk about times when we talk about specific conditions. Further, few people experience symptoms of depression for the entire time that they have depression. For the most part, symptoms come as ""depressive episodes"" that can last for as little as a few days at a time or may last for months or years. Before we get into how these conditions are different, let's look at the symptoms that are common to all forms of major depressive disorders. Low Mood, Low Energy The best-known and most recognizable symptom of depression is the inability to do things. This can be split into low mood and low energy. Low mood includes feelings of sadness or hopelessness, as well as lack of interest. People with depression may not see the point in meeting obligations like going to work. They may also lose interest in things that they used to enjoy, like socializing and doing hobbies. However, some people who have depression may want to do things or understand the importance of doing things but not have the physical energy. As we'll see in a moment, depression comes with physical symptoms too. These can include a lack of energy as well as physical aches and pains that make it difficult to accomplish tasks. Physical Symptoms As mentioned above, some people with major depressive disorders experience physical symptoms, including low energy but also including aches and pains. These can include headaches, stomach pains, and even muscle soreness. Physical symptoms can also include weight loss or weight gain that isn't explained by other factors. While we usually associate depression with people staying in bed all day, it's not always the case. While some people with depression do sleep a lot more, some people with depression have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, which may contribute to feelings of low energy. This is particularly common in children and adolescents with depression, but it can happen to anyone. Thoughts Of Suicide and Death Thoughts of suicide are another well-known symptom of depression, though they are â€“ thankfully â€“ less common. Older adults experiencing depression may be less likely to experience thoughts of suicide but may instead experience obsessive thoughts of death. While not dangerous on their own like thoughts of suicide can be, thoughts of death should be taken seriously as a symptom of depression. Major Depressive Disorder Now that we have a general understanding of general depression let's get into some of the specific major depressive disorders.  A major depressive disorder is a mental health condition manifesting at least five of the major symptoms of depression for at least two weeks.As mentioned above, ""major depressive disorder"" is both a classification of depressive disorders and their own specific condition. However, as specific conditions go, it's not very specific. Major depressive disorder can be treated with medication, talk therapy, or a combination of the two. While some people choose one or the other depending on their personal preferences, ability to pay through insurance, schedule, and other factors, people who use a combination of both therapies typically see the best response in the shortest time. Persistent Depressive Disorder A persistent depressive disorder is similar to major depressive disorder. Still, it involves fewer symptoms with larger gaps in between â€“ but no gap for more than two months â€“ experienced for at least two years. Sometimes, persistent depressive disorder follows major depressive disorder as the individual improves through treatment without seeing complete remission of symptoms. A persistent depressive disorder is typically treated through the same treatments or combinations of treatments. Medical Conditions Some people experience depression as the result of another medical condition, such as those that lead to imbalances of brain chemicals, as some hormonal disorders do. The treatment of disorder in these cases may depend on the underlying medical condition. The condition or medication for that condition may prevent safe medication of the depressive symptoms. However, talk therapy is always an option. Mental Health Conditions Just like mental disorders can be caused or aggravated by physical conditions, major depressive episodes are often caused by more complex mental disorders that also include other symptoms. The most common and familiar examples are seasonal affective disorder and bipolar disorder. The seasonal affective disorder occurs when a lack of sunlight prevents their body from making enough of a vital messenger molecule. This leads to depressive disorders or an increase in depressive episodes during the winter months. In some people, it also leads to manic episodes in the spring when sunlight is prevalent again, and their bodies must adjust. The seasonal affective disorder can be treated through exposure to an artificial light that replicates sunlight.Once called ""manic depression,"" bipolar disorder is a mental condition that leads to alternating cycles of depressive episodes and ""manic episodes"" characterized by high energy, but also sometimes anxiety, lack of focus, and impulsive behavior. Bipolar disorders are typically treated with medication specific to that condition. Co-Occurring Disorders Depending on who you talk to, co-occurring disorders, also called comorbid disorders, can mean several things. The National Alliance on Mental Illness defines co-occurring disorders as a mental disorder experienced at the same time as a substance abuse disorder. This is tragically common as people attempt to relieve the symptoms of their mental health condition by using substances like alcohol and illicit drugs â€“ which in turn worsen their mental health condition. The Anxiety and Depression Association of America defines co-occurring disorders as two or more mental disorders happening at the same time. In the case of depression, this may include substance abuse but may also include anxiety, eating disorders and body dysmorphic disorders, physical conditions as discussed above, and other conditions. No matter how you define co-occurring disorders, the complication of treating them is the same: medication used to treat depression cannot aggravate any of the other conditions. It cannot interact with any other drug â€“ prescribed or otherwise â€“ present in the body. In the case of substance abuse, this means that the individual often undergoes substance abuse counseling and talk therapy until they no longer use the substance and can begin to receive medication for their depression. Of course, talk therapy for their depression is always an option as well. Finding Help No matter what you think may be causing your depressive symptoms, the steps for getting help are the same. Keep A Journal Keeping a journal can help you to establish a timeline for your symptoms, as well as a more complete list of your symptoms. These can help you narrow down or eliminate potential mental disorders. If you decide to go to your care provider for a diagnosis, your journal can help you to get a more accurate diagnosis in a shorter amount of timeâ€”the more detailed the journal, the better. Maintain Social Connections Maintaining social relationships is important in depressive disorders for several reasons. For one thing, it can make depressive disorders less likely in the first place. It also helps when others can point out when you may be approaching a depressive episode. Relationships With Your Care Provider Depression Can Disguise Itself As Many Other IssuesTherapists Can Help To Identify Depression Maintaining a relationship with your care provider might be less fun, but it's just as important. Maintaining a relationship with your care provider can help you to get an accurate diagnosis in as little time as possible. It's particularly important if you have a physical health condition or are taking medication that may cause or aggravate depressive disorders. Know Your Options A theme in this article has been that how you receive treatment for your depressive disorder depends on the depressive disorder that you have. That's particularly true when it comes to medication. However, the other end of the treatment spectrum â€“ talk therapy â€“ is helpful for all kinds of major depression. It's also helpful for people that don't have depression â€“ and diagnosis isn't required to access talk therapy. For most people, seeing a therapist or counselor in person does require a diagnosis in that a diagnosis will help them get their insurance to cover talk therapy. The Takeaway Telehealth talk therapy solutions are a time-effective and cost-effective alternative. For more information about how a telehealth talk therapy solution could be right for you or someone you care about, visit BetterHelp. The sheer number of depressive disorders out there can make having symptoms of depression seem even more hopeless. While we hope that this article gave you some background, the concern over what kind of depressive disorder is causing your symptoms should be more your doctor's concern than yours. All you need to do is make your symptoms to an expert and follow their advice.",2022-08-29,Education
I Received A Diagnosis Of Peripartum Depression: What Should I Do Now?,BetterHelp,"Finding out that you're going to be a parent can bring up extremely complex emotions. As exciting as it is to bring a new life into the world, the initial joy can quickly turn to fear, hopelessness, or anxiety for some pregnant women. After babies are born, it's not unusual to hear that a mother has developed postpartum depression, not to be confused with the ""baby blues,"" which is a short-term state of sadness that usually subsides on its own. Postpartum depression, on the other hand, is a serious and debilitating mental health condition that should be treated alongside a professional. Experiencing Peripartum Depression?Therapy Can Help You Navigate This Change During the time of a woman's pregnancy, her body goes through huge hormonal swings. For a large number of women, the drastic rise and fall of hormones affect their emotions. According to the American Psychological Association, about 1 in 7 women experience postpartum depression. New research shows that postpartum depression can affect partners, too. While most people are familiar with hormonal changes that occur after childbirth, rapid hormonal changes actually begin at the start of pregnancy. When hormonal changes cause depressive symptoms from the beginning of the pregnancy and lasting after the child is born, this is called peripartum depression. Mental health experts prefer the term peripartum depression over postpartum depression because it more accurately reflects the hormonal changes over the life of the pregnancy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 10% of the women that had a live baby had peripartum depression in 2012. This percentage is lower than in 2004 when approximately 14% of women that had a baby had peripartum depression. The researchers attribute the drop in the numbers of women that experienced peripartum depression to better depression screening, better recognition of the risk factors for depression, and improved treatment before and during pregnancy. It's important to note that depression is treatable, and the health of the mother and child needs to address it. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), peripartum depression has been linked to premature births and low birth weights. It can also interfere with a mother and child's attachment, as well as lead to sleeping and eating problems for the baby. According to this research study, children that are toddlers or preschool age whose mothers are depressed are at risk of developing poor self-control, internalizing problems, externalizing problems, having cognitive difficulties, and having difficulty in social interactions. School-age children and adolescents are at increased risk for weakened adaptive functioning, conduct disorders, psychopathology, affective disorders, and anxiety disorders. Children of depressed mothers are also at risk of ADHD and learning disabilities. Researchers have also been on a quest to better understand the frequency of depression peripartum that doesn't respond to treatment.  How to Define the Peripartum Depression According to a 2019 study, peripartum depression is the leading cause of disease burden for women and their families. A woman has a greater risk of being admitted to a psychiatric hospital within the first month after giving birth than at any other time in their life. When symptoms of major depression occur during pregnancy or from one month to six months after the delivery, it indicates a diagnosis of peripartum depression. In another study on peripartum depression, treatment-resistant depression was defined as women who have been prescribed three distinct antidepressants or one antidepressant and one antipsychotic in a year. This study included women with prevalent depression and incident depression. One of the groups included women with peripartum depression, and the other included women with peripartum depression that had been diagnosed three months before giving birth to a live baby or within six months after their child's delivery. Of the 3,207,684 women in the study, 2.5% of them had peripartum depression. Of these women, 5% of those that were diagnosed with peripartum depression developed resistive treatment depression within a year of being diagnosed with depression. The women that had prevalent depression had a 50% higher risk of developing treatment-resistant depression than women that had incident peripartum depression. Those women who eventually developed resistive treatment depression were more likely to acquire substance use disorders, anxiety, insomnia, and other painful conditions. Symptoms Of Peripartum Depression The symptoms of peripartum depression are similar to symptoms for other types of depression. These symptoms can be temporary, or they can last for months or years. Here are some of the symptoms of peripartum depression:  Crying without a valid reason Sluggishness Fatigue Having feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness Not feeling interested in the baby or feeling bonded Loss of interest in things they formerly enjoyed Difficulty concentrating Feeling as though they're a bad mother Irritability Restlessness Anxiety Feeling isolated, guilty, or ashamed of their depression Fear that they might harm the baby or themselves  Experiencing Peripartum Depression?Therapy Can Help You Navigate This Change Fathers Also Experience Postpartum Depression Evidence suggests it as not only mothers that are at risk for peripartum depression. Partners, adoptive parents, and caregivers can also experience peripartum depression after they've had a child. According to an article in U.S. News and World Report, the APA reports that 4% of partners experience depression in their first year after their child's birth. The depression scores were higher for partners that were nonresidents of the household. Both scored higher on the depression scales for resident partners. From early parenthood through the first five years, the scores on depression for resident partners increased by 68%. Also, younger partners, those with significant financial burdens, and those with a history of depression were at an increased risk for depression. It is crucial for parents that are struggling with depression to get help for their symptoms just as mothers should. Getting Help For Peripartum Depression The typical types of treatment for any type of depression are psychotherapy on its own or combined with medication. There are risks for pregnant and nursing women and their babies if they take medications. Women may pass some types of antidepressants on to their babies through the placenta or through breast milk. Because of these known risks, most doctors recommend psychotherapy without medication as the first course of treatment when depression or anxiety is mild. Pregnant women and women that have just given birth should be monitored to ensure that they're on the right treatment course. Withdrawing from antidepressant medications too quickly could pose other serious consequences. There are several things that doctors are concerned about with regard to pregnant or nursing women taking medications. SSRIs are the drug classification of choice in situations when doctors do recommend medication. Doctors caution that women in the postpartum phase of childbirth can be extra sensitive to medications because of the effect that their hormones have on their liver enzymes, the increase in volume for distribution, and having higher levels of drug-binding proteins. For women that are breastfeeding, doctors must consider the effects of medications being transferred through breast milk. It's generally better to find non-medication therapies and safe alternative therapies to treating depression in women in the various childbirth stages. The most preferred treatment for pregnant and nursing women is psychotherapy alone. This type of therapy is usually effective for women that are experiencing mild to moderate peripartum depression. Many women can find relief for their depression symptoms after several sessions of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). Women that involve their partners in psychotherapy also showed improvement in their depressive symptoms. Some women find that getting regular exercise, such as walking with their babies, helps to relieve their symptoms of depression, and some women find no relief from exercise at all. In some physician practices, they recommend having their trained nurses do home visits, so they have an opportunity to observe potential symptoms of peripartum depression. It's important to note that depressive symptoms can be severe. Mothers that are experiencing suicidal thoughts, thoughts of harming themselves or thoughts of harming their newborns require emergency treatment. In this type of situation, it's appropriate to get a psychiatric consultation for inpatient treatment right away for the safety of everyone involved. Considering the high rate of peripartum depression, everyone in the family should be aware of the possibility of depression. If symptoms appear, it's important to get help from a licensed professional therapist right away. The sooner the affected person begins treatment, the more effective it will be. Often, you can get the benefit of psychotherapy for peripartum depression right in the convenience of your own home by requesting online therapy. The important thing is to get evaluated and treated.  Women and men shouldn't feel as though they're bad parents or incapable parents because they're going through a highly emotional time during their pregnancy or after giving birth. Peripartum depression is a biological, medical condition. Don't blame yourself. It's not your fault nor anyone else's fault. With the right treatment, you can start working towards feeling better and start enjoying all the great and wonderful things that go along with being a parent. If you or a loved one are experiencing suicidal thoughts, reach out for help immediately. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline can be reached at 1-800-273-8255, and is available 24/7.

Other medical issues â€“ If you suffer from other medical issues, especially one that is a serious or chronic condition, this may lead to you also developing depression. Past trauma â€“ People with depression have sometimes experienced past trauma, including trauma that happened during the early years of their life.

Here is a look at some of the most common types of depression: Major Depressive Disorder This disorder takes place when you have symptoms of depression that last for many days a week and for at least 2 weeks. The symptoms are likely to interfere in all facets of your life. Persistent Depressive Disorder You may have this disorder if your depression symptoms last over 2 years. At the same time, your symptoms may not be severe the entire time, but wax and wane throughout that period. Bipolar Disorder Bipolar Disorder is a disorder where someone feels periods of up, or elevated moods, which is called mania, and periods where they feel down, which is depression. Bipolar disorder is serious and maybe something that affects you for many years. The condition is characterized by symptoms that can impact your health greatly, so bipolar disorder is a disorder that must be monitored by a healthcare professional. If you think you may have this disorder, you should seek out treatment quickly so that you can start to manage your symptoms. There are multiple types of bipolar disorder, which are different depending on the amount of time you have experienced symptoms. Not all types of bipolar disorder have an equal amount of time spent in depression and manic moods, and in some cases, the feelings are present a long time but are minor. In short, bipolar disorder differs from depression in the fact that there are additional feelings of mania that may affect you when depressive symptoms are not being experienced. Treatment Options In terms of treatment options, there are techniques you can add to your home routine, and there is professional help that can greatly benefit you. Things To Change There are a few things you can change in your day-to-day life, which can help improve your outlook and may boost the other treatments you are taking advantage of as well.  Don't isolate yourself. When you are experiencing the symptoms of depression, you may feel like you don't want to be around anyone and that you need to keep to yourself. You should not do this. Take the time to hang out with friends or family members sometimes, and they may be able to provide the moral support that you need.  Wondering If What You are Experiencing Could Be Depression?Talk With An Experienced Therapist    Take things slowly. Even when there are big projects that you are working on or you have to get a lot of things done, you must remember that you can't do many things at once. Try to break large tasks into smaller, more manageable tasks, so you won't get overwhelmed. Exercise and eat right. Even if you just exercise a little bit, this can do your body good and may also help keep your moods in check. Keeping up with a balanced diet should also be able to help your moods and is beneficial for your overall health too. Learn to relax. Take time to relax when you need to. Sometimes when stress or the things you have to do are causing you to feel anxious or run down, you need to take a few minutes to just breathe and relax. Some people opt for meditation, and others enjoy taking warm baths. What you do to relax is up to you. Start doing things again. One of the symptoms of depression is that you don't feel like you want to do things that you used to like.  A way to change this is to start taking part in activities you previously enjoyed. Perhaps you really like cooking or painting. Start to do these things again, and you may be able to remember why you liked these activities in the first place. Listen to the professionals. You do not have to go through depression alone. When you are paying attention to the signs and are in the process of getting the right treatment to improve your mental health, you should always listen to the professionals. They will be able to help you alleviate symptoms, and this can really change your life.  Psychotherapy Speaking to a psychiatrist or other mental health professional about your depression, symptoms, and more is something that should be done.  They will be able to discuss specific treatment options with you, and this may help you start to be able to think differently so you can be more hopeful and able to see promise for the future. Moreover, there are options available to you in person or online. Online therapy is accessible in many places, but a leader in online treatment is BetterHelp. They have professionals that can talk to you any day of the week and are there when you need them. As technology changes, proper mental health care options must evolve too. A 2015 study states that there are effective online therapy options out there that help with depression. Medications There are a few specific medications available that may be able to help control many of the symptoms of depression. You must talk to your doctor or therapist about which ones you should take, and your doses must be monitored closely to ensure that they are working the way they are supposed to. Overview When you start to notice the signs that you are acting differently, have a loss of interest in things that you used to hold dear, or you are experiencing many of the symptoms listed above, you may be suffering from depression. If you are, there's no reason that you have to live with this. You can take action and seek the help you need. There are multiple treatment options you can rely on. Obtaining treatment is the best way to ensure that your symptoms will be manageable. Some experience depression for many years, and there is no ""cure."" However, this doesn't mean there isn't hope since you can still live your life and do the things you enjoy. Don't ignore the signs when they are passing you by; remember that your mental health is important, and needs to be addressed when something is affecting it negatively.",2022-08-18,Diagnosis

You will have to be diagnosed by a doctor to be sure, but you should know that there are multiple types of depression, which vary in terms of severity and the symptoms present. How Do You Get Depression? No one knows for sure exactly what causes depression, but according to medically reviewed articles on Healthline Media, there are several risk factors that may contribute to an individual developing depression. These include family history of mental illness, stressful life events, and chronic illness or chronic pain. Genetic Reasons As with most types of mental illness, if someone in your family has depression or has had it in the past, it may be in your genes. This might translate into you experiencing depression yourself. Periods Of Extreme Stress Of Major Changes As noted by medically reviewed sources, stressful life events can contribute to the onset of depression. Whenever someone suffers a loss or setback, this can lead them to have more stress than usual. It can also lead to depression. A major loss or setback consists of an event like the death of a loved one, a divorce, or moving to a new city. Many of these things are unavoidable, so it is important to be able to handle stress well when you can. When you can't, there is help available. Chronic Illness If you have a chronic illness, a major illness, or you experience chronic pain, this may cause you to have depression as well. You might feel like there's no hope and that things aren't going to get better, which can affect your thoughts and life. Medicines There is a chance that the medicines you take will cause depressive symptoms as a side effect. Be sure to read information pertaining to the prescriptions you take and ask your doctor if this is possible. The best way to note this is to keep a headache journal. Write in this journal when you have a headache, describe how long it lasted and how you felt. This information can be the key to determining underlying issues when they are present, and it can also let both you and your doctor know how frequently you are experiencing this type of pain. What Are The Symptoms of Depression  There are many symptoms of depression that may plague you. Medically reviewed sources list symptoms of major depression as:  Appetite changes Weight loss or gain Problems with sleeping Issues with decision making Feelings of irritability Loss of interest in usual activities Feeling tired all the time No motivation Feeling sad A feeling like nothing matters, pessimism Unable to sit still Various physical symptoms, including headaches Thoughts of death or suicide  If you or a loved one are experiencing suicidal thoughts, reach out for help immediately. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline can be reached at 1-800-273-8255 and is available 24/7. Can Depression Cause Headaches Depression may cause you to face different types of headaches. In fact, it isn't the only mental health issue that can cause headaches. Anxiety disorders can also cause headaches, and this may happen for a number of reasons. In one medically reviewed study, nearly 20 percent of people that experienced headaches also had depression. This is just one study, but it still shows that there is a possible link between the two. Why Does Depression Cause Headaches? Possible reasons that depression causes headaches are due to changes in your diet, becoming more sedentary, and even due to increased times of stress, you might begin to experience. Those that have headaches and depression may experience different types of headaches, including chronic migraine and tension type headaches. Migraines A migraine is a type of headache that comes on unexpectedly. Some people that are affected may suffer from pain for days at a time, which can put a damper on the tasks they need to get done, as well as their home and personal life. During a migraine attack, an individual will generally be sensitive to lights, sounds, or smells, and may also feel nauseous. A migraine attack can last anywhere from 4 to 72 hours if untreated. Medically reviewed sources have determined a link between depression and migraine. Tension Type Headaches Depression Can Look Different For EveryoneFind What Works For You With A Therapist Tension type headaches are often brought on when you have a lot of stress. They cause pain in your head, and you may also feel pain in your neck. A tension headache can change in intensity as you become tenser, so the pain can get worse throughout the day. Experiencing a tension type headache can significantly impact carrying out daily responsibilities and tasks. Headaches may be different for everyone that gets them. For example, if you are a person with chronic migraines and are in pain many days a month, this might cause you to have depression. Once you are under the supervision of a doctor, they will be better able to determine if underlying depression is causing headaches, or if the opposite is true. There is a possible link between depression and anxiety as well, in regards to headaches. People that have chronic migraines often experiences anxiety disorders too. They may also have symptoms of underlying depression. This link has been studied and mentioned in a 2017 medically reviewed study. This issue should be studied more, so we will know exactly what the link between anxiety and depression is, as well as why tension type headaches and other headaches are prevalent for those with depression. What Can I do? When it comes to treating headaches that occur alongside depression, you will likely need to be treated for both of these things. A mental health professional can assist in developing a treatment plan. If you have tension type headaches, this will likely require you to take certain medicines and learn strategies that can help you effectively manage your tension. You may also need to take advantage of prescriptions, so you will be able to lessen the depressive symptoms you are experiencing. According to Mayo Clinic, medications that are used in the treatment of depression include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). A doctor may be concerned about your headaches and perform tests to rule out other illnesses or causes as well. This can help you better understand if your headaches are a symptom of depression or if something else is going on. Other potential causes of headaches are head injury, high blood pressure or infection. Medically reviewed articles on Healthline Media list options for treatment of depression including psychotherapy. This is an important aspect in the treatment of depression and can be valuable as well. You can take advantage of in-person treatment or online treatment, both of which can be quite effective. The goal of psychotherapy is to offer you tools to help you think differently and be able to get through your day, even when you are experiencing depression and anxiety. As far as online therapy goes, BetterHelp is a useful resource. They feature online-based therapy services, which can help you when and where it is convenient for you. Research published in the Harvard Review of Psychiatry states that online therapy can be of use when treating depression. You may access online therapy platforms from the comfort and safety of your own home. Are There Other Things I Can Do For A Headache? There are a few other natural remedies you can try to get rid of a headache, no matter if they are caused by depression and anxiety, or something else.   Lay in a cool and dark room when you're in pain. Consider getting a massage to help rid yourself of tension. Use a cold or hot pack on the area of your head that is in pain. Relax when you can. Fix your diet. Exercise at least every other day. Stay away from alcohol. Take things slow, where you don't try to do everything at once.  Prognosis The prognosis for treatment when it comes to depression and migraine, or tension type headaches is positive. Both of these things can be treated, especially when you are being treated by qualified professionals. There is no ""cure"" for depression, but the symptoms can be alleviated, and in some cases, some may go away entirely. Your headaches might be able to be cleared up as well, with the proper medicine, and in the case of tension type headaches, when you can lessen things in your life that cause tension. These are things to discuss with your mental health professionals who will be able to come up with a long-term plan to help you. Take advantage of the help they can provide for you. You should always remember to take your time with the things that you do and understand that some things will get done, and others may not. It is more important for you to be able to relax and lessen symptoms, so it is okay to take some time for you. Other people will understand that you need to work through your anxiety and depression, and you'll need to go at your own pace. Each person's recovery through depression and headaches is different, so hang in there and begin a plan that will work well for you.

8 Tips For Beating Depression,BetterHelp,"Most everyone is familiar with the feeling of sadness or grief. Feeling upset over a breakup, a test grade, or the death of a loved one is completely normal and is part of a healthy grieving process. For many people, most bouts of sadness will be brief. However, some individuals struggle with a mental disorder called depression. In any given year, depression affects about 6.7% of adults, and 16.6% of the population will experience depression at one point in their lives. Generally, depression first arises during the late teenage years into the mid-20s. Men and women are at risk of developing a depressive disorder, however, women tend to be more likely to experience these symptoms. While depression is common amongst populations worldwide, the positive news is that it most definitely is treatable. Between 80 and 90% of individuals treated for depression respond well and gain relief from their symptoms. There is no one specific method that will work for everyone, treating depression is often done using a combination of lifestyle changes, medication, and professional help. It's Possible To Overcome Depression And Enjoy Life AgainGet Help From A Therapist Online What Is Depression? To begin understanding how to beat this disorder, it's best to understand exactly what it is. According to the American Psychiatric Association, depression is a mental illness that causes low moods, a loss of interest in activities, and low self-esteem. Everyone gets upset from time to time, but major depressive disorder is characterized by experiencing these symptoms for over two weeks. Other symptoms of depression may include changes in appetite, disordered sleep patterns, fatigue, trouble with decision-making, being less concentrated (known as brain fog), or suicidal thoughts. How Is Depression Diagnosed? Many factors can play a role in the onset of a depressive disorder. Differing hormone levels in the brain, genetics, natural personality, or environmental factors such as an unhealthy home life all may contribute to an individual's likelihood to develop a depressive disorder. If an individual begins experiencing symptoms, a health professional will then conduct a diagnostic evaluation. The evaluation is then utilized to make a specific care plan that may include multiple different treatment options, which will hopefully help the individual beat depression! Tips to Beat Depression As mentioned, there are many different treatment options for those struggling with a depressive disorder. These 9 tips are some of those options that can be integrated into daily life in order to treat or aid depression, but remember that a health professional's word is always best, and if these methods aren't working, visit a doctor to develop a more intense and proactive plan. Tip #1: Make Lifestyle Changes Lifestyle changes are often one of the top recommended tips for fighting and beating depression. Instituting a daily exercise regimen, getting adequate sleep, and eating healthier can all positively impact moods. Different types of exercise release many hormones or proteins that help combat depressive symptoms. High-intensity exerciseâ€”think vigorous cardio or a strenuous weight-lifting sessionâ€”can release endorphins (the feel-good chemical), which leads to a happier mood directly after a workout. However, lower-intensity aerobic exercises release neurotrophic factors, which allow nerve cells to produce new connections in the brain. This increases brain activity and allows the hippocampus (the brain region which regulates mood) to grow and therefore raise low moods. Sleep and depression are intricately related, with insomnia appearing in tandem with depressive disorders. By constructing a healthy sleep schedule and getting enough sleep each night, daily moods will be higher. Low sleep leads to anxiety, low performance, brain fog, and irritation, all symptoms of depression. Keeping up on sleep can help ease some of these symptoms. Finally, keeping a healthy diet can have an incredible effect on easing depressive symptoms or even preventing depression in the future. An adherence to health professional's dietary recommendations, adopting an anti-inflammatory diet, excluding high processed foods, and making sure to eat adequate amounts of folic acid and fatty acids have all been shown to reduce an individual's risk of mental illness. By eating healthier, an individual also improves his self-esteem levels, which may also enhance mood and combat depression.  Tip #2: Create SMART Goals SMART is an acronym for ""specific"", ""measurable"", ""achievable"", ""realistic"" and ""timely"". Those struggling with a depressive disorder often feel like they lack interest in normal activities or have trouble concentrating on or completing tasks. Often, this leads to low achievement, which may add to an individual's low self-esteem. Creating workable goals allows an individual to set goals that will lead to a sense of achievement. These goals should be guided by the ""SMART"" acronyms, ensuring that an individual should work towards the goal, but it should not add stress or discomfort to their life. They can be small or big, but they should be something that excites and motivates the individual. Ideally, it will give the individual a sense of purpose and achievement, two things that those with depression struggle with. In addition, since those with depression often struggle on concentration, having a concrete goal to keep them on task may help ease brain fog and increase productivity. Tip #3: Reduce Stress Stress can be a huge factor in exacerbating depression. Engaging in stressful situations at school or work can worsen depressive symptoms. Reducing stress in any manner can help and individual beat depression, whether that includes avoiding situations altogether or creating a stress management system to deal with them. In a study done on nursing students, researchers found that instituting a stress management training program to teach these students how to cope with stress significantly lowered depression and anxiety. By eliminating or effectively coping with stress, depressive disorders may be eased as well. Tip #4: Build a Community Those with depression often feel that they do not have the energy to interact with others. However, positive interaction with friends and family can improve mental health and allow an individual to feel that they are loved and cared for. Focusing on positive relationships and cutting ties with individuals that seem to negatively affect one's mood can allow for a more positive and inclusive community. This may help an individual feel less isolated, a major depressive symptom. By planning fun events with friends or family, an individual can even regain a sense of interest in activities and projects. Tip #5: Practice Self-Care Techniques The act of self-care is defined as any activity that an individual does deliberately to look out for or care for their physical, mental, or emotional health. Since it is so individualized, many times, a self-care technique that works for one person won't work for another. However, taking the time to practice self-care is key to reduced stress, anxiety, and depression. Practicing self-care helps combat depressive episodes as it is the analyzation and treatment of specific depressive symptoms. It can come in many different forms, as different people find that different techniques help them combat symptoms more successfully. One self-care technique may come in the form of saying ""no"" to activities that can trigger depressive symptoms. For example, if work is stressful, practice avoiding answering work emails at night or during off-hours. Mindfulness is another self-care technique that involves staying aware and accepting of thoughts and feelings, without forming judgment towards them. This will allow those struggling with depression to feel more in control and conscious of how they are feeling, as well as be able to predict how they may respond to a certain situation. Practicing mindfulness is proven to help combat depression and negative emotions. Meditation is similar to mindfulness but is often centered around one core theme: whether it is de-stressing, positivity, or something else, listening to a meditation guide can help ease anxiety and dispel negative feelings. It's Possible To Overcome Depression And Enjoy Life AgainGet Help From A Therapist Online Tip #6: Practice Self-Esteem Techniques Like self-care, which self-esteem techniques are most successful are often unique to the individual. Those with depression often struggle with low self-esteem or intrusive negative thoughts about intellectual ability, body image, or social ability. To dispel those thoughts, many recommend instilling positive self-talk into a daily ritual. One self-esteem technique could be to list everything positive about oneself, no matter how small. For example, it could be: ""I like the color of my eyes,"" or ""I am talented at chemistry."" Avoid listing negative perceptions. Over time, individuals will find it easier to focus on the positive aspects and therefore, raise self-esteem. Tip #7: Talk to a Therapist While therapy has often been stigmatized in the past, it is one of the best ways to combat depressive episodes. Talking to a professional about feelings, symptoms, or effects of depression can dispel thoughts of loneliness as well as give an individual the ability to gain professional insight on their disorder. Therapists are professionally trained to help individuals combat depression and will likely use a combination of practices to help ease symptoms. Two ""talk therapy"" techniques are CBT (cognitive-behavioral therapy) and DBT (dialectical behavior therapy). CBT teaches individuals how their thoughts, feelings, and actions all influence one another. It allows individuals to see relationships that can lead to negative thought patterns and low moods and change factors of those relationships in order to improve mental health overall. CBT is often short-term therapy and very skill-oriented, with a focus on teaching skills for improving mental health and how to apply those skills in the future. DBT is an offshoot of CBT that places more emphasis on social and emotional aspects. DBT best helps individuals that struggle with unstable emotions or extreme mood swings, as it is designed to help regulate emotions. Through both CBT and DBT, individuals can learn important mood management skills as well as healthy coping mechanisms that can help them overcome depressive disorders. Tip #8: See a Doctor While any of these tips or a combination of a few may help some individuals overcome depression, at times, more intensive treatment is needed. If an individual is struggling with more severe depression or has had recurring symptoms with little relief, then talking to a doctor may prove extremely helpful. Doctors can prescribe medication that helps regulate brain chemistry. These antidepressants can fluctuate in effectivity between person to person, so communicating regularly with doctors can ensure that the dosage or type of medication is the most helpful it can be. Avoid going off medication without a doctor's approval, as symptoms may reoccur within a few days. Overall, depression is an incredibly individualized disorder, with many unique symptoms appearing in different individuals. That calls for individualized treatment plans and mechanisms. Luckily, there are many options out there, from practicing self-care to hiring a therapist. While depression may seem all-consuming, remember that almost 90% of individuals with depression fully recover. Creating a treatment plan and changing it to best fit specific needs will see the most success and help those struggling to fully regain their mental health and their life.

Is Cat Depression Real? Common Signs And Symptoms,BetterHelp,"As any Garfield cartoon strip can attest, cats can be testy creatures. Much-beloved though they may be, cats often have a reputation for being somewhat grumpy or tempestuous in nature and are usually seen as less forgiving and more antagonistic than other pets. Nevertheless, some cat owners have viewed a sudden change in their cats' behavior, and are left asking the question: is cat depression real? And more importantly, does my cat have it? Think Your Cat May Be Depressed?Learn To Help Your Cat Through Therapy What Is Depression? Depression is a mood disorder that is most commonly identified in humans. In people, depression is marked by mood and personality changes, constant misery or depressed mood, apathy, and loss of interest or motivation. Although these are the most common symptoms in adult humans, it may surprise people to learn that pets, wild animals, and even livestock can all show symptoms of depression. Like humans, these symptoms are usually preceded by an event, large or small, that sets a chain of changes in motion. Depression In Felines: Symptoms and Causes Depression in cats is somewhat similar to depression in humans, in that it can change mood and personality norms, and can go undetected for some time before cat owners worry something is amiss. Although the precise symptoms of cat depression depend on the personality and temperament of the animal in question, there are several commonalities, including:   Communication changes. If the cat suspected of being depressed is usually a vocal one, loudly communicating that it wants to go outside, that it needs food, or wants affection, these vocal commands and requests may suddenly decrease or stop altogether. If the cat is typically quiet and reserved, it may suddenly grow loud and agitated, yowling constantly, and seemingly without cause. Bowel changes. Cats who were once pristine litter box visitors may begin urinating or defecating outside of the litter box. This change in behavior may be obvious, with cats relieving themselves in plain view on the carpet or floor, or may be more covert, hiding their indiscretions in houseplants, under blankets, or ensconced in bags or shoes. Appetite changes. If a cat is depressed, they may experience a loss of appetite, though some cats may exhibit greater interest in food. If a cat that was previously a healthy eater suddenly begins leaving food uneaten or no longer drinks water, it could be a clear indicator of depressionâ€”or another illness, as this particular symptom is often a symptom of physical illness, as well. Sleep changes. Depressed cats might also exhibit changes in their standard sleeping patterns. Cats may suddenly begin sleeping more, and in odd spaces, or may seem on edge, and seem to have dwindled down their usual sleeping time. Depression, generally, affects all creatures' ability and willingness to sleep. Personality changes. Cats who are temperamental and antagonistic may demonstrate increasingly erratic and aggressive behavior, while previously docile cats may begin to behave in more aggressive and upset patterns. Although depression is usually associated with sadness, depressed cats may actually exhibit more symptoms that would be associated with anger.  Now that the symptoms of cat depression have been identified, most cat owners come to the question of ""why?"" Cat depression does not usually creep up gradually, due to genetic factors, but is more commonly related to an event that has occurred recently. Cats, like all animals, are sensitive creatures (despite what their nature may suggest) and can have significant reactions to stressors, changes in routine, and even changes in scenery. The most likely causes of cat depression include:  Cats may become depressed if they lose a family member, whether that family member is a kitten, a sibling, a parent, or an owner, all of which can trigger a severe reaction. A sad cat is one who may have had their home ripped away from them when their owner moves or they are returned to a shelter. When a cat is depressed, it may feel a sense of loss when a child leaves home, a pet passes away, or an owner has a sudden surge in work hours. Each of these can lead to a sad cat, intent on letting you know that something is wrong. Change is difficult for animals, and change can cause depression in cats. Changes do not have to be significant; a cat can become depressed due to a change in food, a relocated litter box, or the addition of a new pet in the home. Injury and Illness. This is perhaps one of the trickier causes of cat depression, as many symptoms of cat depression actually mimic illness. Nevertheless, a depressed cat may be an ill cat, whether that illness is relatively easy to cure, such as a Urinary Tract Infection, or more difficult to treat, such as cancer. This is one of the reasons mood changes in animals should never be ignored. Lack of Attention. Although cats have a reputation for not caring about attention and affection the way their canine counterparts do, this is far from the truth; like most domesticated animals, cats require affection and attention to function optimally, and a lack of adequate attention can lead to cat depression. Simple Differences. Different cat breeds, ages, and temperaments can all lend themselves disproportionately to the development of depression and other conditions.  Treating Feline Depression Because the symptoms of depression in cats can mimic so many other conditions, it is vital to take your cat to the vet if any symptoms of depression arise; the vet will be able to treat depression and evaluate your cat for any additional issues that may be at play. Treating feline depression does differ from treating depression in humans. In humans, depression is treated through a series of interventions, which may include lifestyle interventions, pharmaceutical medication, and psychotherapy. Because cats cannot verbally communicate their concerns, nor can they engage in therapy in the same way as humans, treatment for depression in cats focuses on eliminating potential co-morbidities, improving the situation at home, and potentially medication (but usually only for a short period). Although cats can experience depression following some of the same things as humans (the loss of a loved one, for instance), they will not experience it for the same extended period as humans, and pharmaceutical intervention for cats will not carry with it the same duration or intensity. Think Your Cat May Be Depressed?Learn To Help Your Cat Through Therapy Treating feline depression is often not merely a matter of treating the cat, but encouraging the cat's owner to make changes. If the cat's depression has come on the heels of a change such as a move, change in food, or change in kitty litter location, the vet may suggest that you mitigate these changes as much as possible and, where it is available, make less drastic changes. If, for instance, an owner wants to move a litter box from a bathroom to a laundry room, it would be better to make small, incremental changes to the location over a long period of time, rather than making a single, drastic change all at once. This can help return a cat's mood to normal. Symptoms of Improvement The greatest indicator of a cat's improvement following treatment is the restoration of your cat's personality. If your cat once again comes out of hiding, eats well, sleeps well, and is displaying affection, it is usually safe to say that the depression period is over. Long-Term Outlook Unfortunately, depression in cats could come back easily, if any changes have occurred, or the cat feels a sense of loss or fear. Preventing cat depression can be done, though, and usually involves making sure changes to routine are not abrupt or severe, keeping close contact with the cat through daily playing and attention, and taking steps to comfort a cat who has experienced the loss of an owner, another pet in the home, or a parent or sibling. Cats can be wonderful animals to take care of, and can even be prescribed by mental health professionals, such as those working through BetterHelp, to function as therapy or emotional support animals. Despite their nature as wonderful companions and therapeutic creatures, cats can be prone to health concerns, including depression. Staying on top of all symptoms will ensure the best outcome for the cat, and will help both you and your cat's vet determine the root of the issue. Remember that depression in animals is not as straightforward as depression in humans, and is often a symptom of a physical ailment, rather than a condition all on its own. Making sure to treat your cat with love, affection, and care can go a long way in both preventing and treating depression in cats, and can have a positive effect on your mood and happiness, as well. While depression may not often be thought of in regard to cats, some animal health workers do believe that cats can experience bouts of depression, and owners would do well to note any symptoms the cat may have, present those symptoms to a veterinarian, and have the cat evaluated for any additional symptoms or conditions.

Nutrition and Depression: Meals to Aid Mental Health,BetterHelp,"Depression is often thought of as an isolated condition, primarily affecting the brain and emotions. In literature, media, and even in some medical research, the mechanisms of depression are relegated almost entirely to the mind, rather than bringing the rest of the body into the picture to identify the whole-body connection to health, mental health, and depression. This connection could be a significant means of adequately treating depressive symptoms and other mental health issues. Want To Learn About The Link Between Nutrition And Depression?Speak With A Licensed Therapist Nutrition: How Food Affects the Body The food people eat become the blocks through which the entire body is built. Although much of nutrition has been boiled down to ""calories in and calories out."" Nutrition is far more than a simple equation of making sure you are consuming X number of calories, and exercising X number of calories, to either sustain your body or create a deficit (in the case of weight loss). Instead, each time a morsel of food enters the body, a multi-varied and complex reaction begins instantaneously. The entire body works in harmony to properly digest food, assimilate nutrients, and expel any unnecessary material. Far from calories or weight being the sole determinants of a healthy diet, designed to improve and enrich mental health, eating for mental health means eating whole, fresh foods, and limiting exposure to processed, packaged, and hyper-palatable foods, such as hot dogs, candy, and fried foods, to keep your mental health functioning optimally. Although food consumption is all too often viewed primarily through the lens of weight and heart disease, food contributes significantly to all areas of bodily health, from circulatory health to mental health, to emotional health. Food is the matter that human bodies are created with. Failing to provide healthy and nutrient-dense foods result in diseaseâ€”even if that disease manifests as a mental health issue, rather than obesity, diabetes, or heart disease. Far from being just an issue of weight, diet is a matter of overall health, wellness, and resilience, and can have dramatic and overwhelming impacts on mental health concerns. Depression: A Review ""Depression"" is a blanket term used to describe mental health disorders, most commonly known as depressive disorders. These disorders include (but are not limited to) Bipolar Disorders, Major Depressive Disorder, and Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder. Far from just ""feeling sad,"" depression involves a complete change in an individual's personality, mental health, and life, with symptoms creeping their way into every aspect of life. People with depression may experience sleep disturbances, appetite changes, weight changes, increased levels of anxiety, decreased interest in things previously loved or passionate about, and difficulty finding motivation. Understandably, treating depression and doing so effectively is of great value in improving mental health and general health.  Food and Depression Food can both detract from and add to depression. Meals comprised primarily of hot dogs, frozen lasagna, and sodium-rich canned vegetables can wreak havoc on general health (and, by virtue, mental health), while diets rich in whole foods can actively aid general health and, by proxy, mental health. Although food is not typically enough to completely heal an individual from depression or depressive symptoms, mental health can be vastly improved by a better diet plan and enhanced general health. When searching for a way to improve mental health, food is an excellent place to start. The mechanisms behind food and depression are not clear-cut, nor will they be the same for everyone; for instance, someone who struggles with both depression and an eating disorder might struggle with feelings of shame and disgust that follow eating. People who struggle with depression and anxiety might worry they are taking too much food from the table and refrain from eating to satiety, instead always shortchanging themselves. Individuals who struggle solely with depression might struggle to find an appetite robust enough to take in daily caloric and nutritive needs regularly. With that being said, there are some ways in which food and nutrition consistently interact with depression and mental health. These include:  Improved health: Even in the presence of depression, improving eating habits will improve general health. General health can increase the body's ability to synthesize and distribute nutrients properly and may have a hand in regulating and supporting hormone production, which may be faulty in individuals with depression. Improving diet could improve mental health. Elevated mood: Even in the presence of depression, eating healthy food improves general bodily function, leading to elevated mood. However, the ""elevated mood"" in question may not wholly ease the symptoms of depression, it can be an excellent source of support and complementary treatment for individuals struggling with mental health disorders. Improved bodily function: All systems in the body run more efficiently if they are adequately powered and motivated, including your mental health. Food is the fuel by which all bodily systems function, and failing to provide adequate fuel in one area can lead to a breakdown in other areas. If, for instance, the mouth is not producing the enzymes required to begin breaking down a bite of hot dogs, the stomach's bile production might not be adequate to effectively break down and assimilate the nutrients in a food item. These nutrients may then not be properly removed from the food and sent to various bodily systems, leading to a breakdown in the proper liver and kidney function, not to mention the gastrointestinal system. Although this is not problematic in isolation, consistently eating foods that do not interact synergistically in the body will result in inflammation and the breakdown of basic bodily systemsâ€”including mental health.  Want To Learn About The Link Between Nutrition And Depression?Speak With A Licensed Therapist Although the Great Depression refers to a time in history, it can feel as though it is aptly applied to individuals struggling with intense and long-term symptoms of mental health decline such as depression. Like the Great Depression and depression-era struggles, individuals with a diagnosis of a depressive disorder or suspicion of such a disorder are fighting a heavy tide in trying to stay on top of symptoms and manage their condition. Food and proper nutrition are just one of the ways in which treatment plans can be more thoroughly supported and complemented to improve mental health. Meals to Aid Mental Health While Depression-era foods are often regarded with a sense of bleak sadness, there was some invention involved for many families living through the Great Depression. This same inventive spirit can help individuals with depression fight their symptoms and improve their overall health. Inventiveness may be necessary to incorporate all of the elements recommended by health professionals (in both the mental health and physical health fields). Some of the ingredients and recommendations may not be easy to come by. The following dietary identifiers and parameters may help individuals diagnosed with depression or are showing symptoms of a mental health disorder. They are:  The Mediterranean Diet: The Mediterranean diet is a dietary framework that emphasizes healthy fats and lean proteins and natural carbohydrates. This diet places a greater emphasis on savory foods and does not include foods with extremely high glycemic content, instead opting for the rich flavors of fats, oils, vegetables, lemon juice, and fish. This particular diet has been linked to a decreased likelihood of depression and improved mental health. Low Carbohydrate Diets: Although the official recommendation from the governing board of dietetics suggests that carbohydrates should make up the bulk of an individual's diet, low carbohydrate diets have been linked to improving general health. This is likely due to the types of carbohydrates being consumed, rather than the actual number of carbohydrates being consumed. Carbohydrates derived from fruits and vegetables and whole grains are far superior to the carbohydrates that come from highly-processed foods and grains that have been degraded and processed down to the endosperm, which have lower nutrient contents and may promote inflammation. Inflammation can lead to mental health distress.  The Links To Diet and Depression Although the precise reasons for the interaction between diet and depression are not precisely known and warrant further study. There are some suggestions that inflammation is largely the cause; diets high in processed, hyper-palatable foods dramatically increase the likelihood of whole-body inflammation. This leads to a host of health problems, diabetes, obesity, heart disease, and some have postulated, even dementia later in life. All of these inflammation areas can make the proper pathways to regulate hormone function, nutrient absorption, and distribution, and detox function to decrease. Causing the body to accrue a buildup of waste material, harmful substances, and lipid deposits, all of which can further throw the human body into disrepair and inflammation. Depression is frequently linked to skewed hormones, which could be tied back to diet, inflammation, and impaired hormone, nutrient, and detox functions. Diet matters for mental health. Although this is important work to consider and the conclusions drawn about the importance of a healthy diet when treating depression matter significantly, it can feel overwhelming for individuals in the midst of depression to implement an entirely new dietary regimenâ€”especially one that removes comfort and convenience foods, in favor of fresh, whole foods that require preparation. It is for this reason that people with depression could not only learn eating habits from the Depression era (making do with what one has, creating unique combinations of food, and finding ways to create food where there was none) but could also benefit from the intervention of a mental health professional who has worked in both nutrition and psychotherapy, or a nutrition coach who is willing to work alongside a mental health practitioner, including those who work through online platforms such as BetterHelp. Treating mental health can be a long road, and adding another element to a treatment plan can feel daunting for some. But just as people were able to pull through the Great Depression stronger, more resilient, and with a greater understanding of how to care for themselves. Individuals who dive deep into diet and how it interferes or interacts with depression and mental health may find themselves developing greater strength and resilience for future struggles with depression. Learning how to create food plans to help manage and treat depression may be done with a single doctor, whose focus is on both psychology and nutrition, or it may be done with a treatment team, including a nutritionist or dietician, and a mental health practitioner. Whichever route you take, remember that diet alone may not be enough to change the symptoms of depression. However, it is often a powerful and important piece of the mental health puzzle that allows people with depression to manage their symptoms, and experience long-term change.

What Depression Looks Like: How To Help Someone You Know Cope,BetterHelp,"Do you know someone living with depression and wonder how you can help? The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that over 300 million children and adults live with depression. Symptoms of depression vary from person to person, making each experience with the mental illness unique. However, when someone you know is depressed, you may notice a change in their mood or energy. There are things you can do to help while keeping in mind, things to avoid. Learn The Best Ways To Help Loved Ones Cope With DepressionSpeak With A Therapist Online Let Them Know You'll Listen Symptoms of depression may include isolation from others. A depressed person may choose to hold in their feelings because they think they don't matter, or no one will listen to them. Start by letting them know you are concerned. Avoid being pushy with questions. You can ask them what is on their mind or if they want to get something off their chest. They may be willing to talk but hold off on giving any advice. If they are eager to open up, ask questions to get a better idea of what they are feeling. Try not to assume you know what they mean. Show empathy to validate their feelings. Let them know you care, especially if they are not willing to speak about their feelings at this time. Assist In Getting Support Your friend may not realize they are depressed, or they may not know where to go or how to reach out to manage their symptoms of depression. Even if they know they have options for getting help, it may not be easy for them to take the first step. Some find it daunting to choose a therapist. If they are interested in counseling, offer to help them review their options. Help them consider factors in selecting a therapist. Assist with creating a list of questions to ask at their first session. When they are ready to make the first appointment, be there to encourage them. Suggest Therapy Or Keep Encouraging Them To Go If your friend or loved one isn't in therapy to help manage their symptoms of depression, mention the option to them. Therapy provides a unique insight into one's thoughts and feelings. It is an option that helps people work through their depression productively with personalized approaches to their problems or concerns. If they seem uninterested in the idea, try encouraging them to at least look into it. They can participate in online therapy sessions or work with a local therapist in person. It is common for people managing major depression to attend regular therapy sessions. Sometimes a depressed person may feel like canceling their appointment if they are not in a good mood. Encourage them to keep their appointments. The same is true for any medications they are taking or other actions that are part of their treatment. Encourage them to stick with their plan. Be supportive if they want to make changes to their treatment, but encourage them to talk to their doctor or mental health specialist about their thoughts. Offer A Helping Hand With Daily Tasks People living with depression may feel overwhelmed by everyday tasks. Sometimes their level of energy or ability to concentrate hinders their ability to get things done. They may experience depression symptoms such as lack of sleep or inability to make decisions.  Your help may be appreciated, but they may not know how to express it in words. Ask if they need assistance with something in particular or if they need help with a task for the day. If you notice something needs to be done, ask if you can help them with it.  For example, if they are low on food, you could ask about picking up a few things for them at the grocery store. Maybe you could offer to write their shopping list or cook a meal together. You can help them get things done around the house and make it an enjoyable task with some music and good conversation. Sometimes having company over makes completing tasks more manageable. Keep Activity Invites Open Lack of social or hobby interests is common depression symptoms. People living with depression and anxiety may find it challenging to reach out to others or keep a planned activity. They may feel guilty about canceling and assume others won't want to invite them if they have a history of withdrawing in the past. Invite your friend to upcoming events, even if you know they may turn it down. Let them know you understand if they don't accept the invite. When they feel like attending, let them know you are happy to see them. Maintain Patience And Communication Let your friend know you'll be there for them as they work through their depression. Treating depression symptoms takes time. The course of treatment depends on how symptoms affect their lifestyle and the type of symptoms they experience. Symptoms of depression may come and go, and that effect can be challenging for your friend. While your friend is doing their best to manage their depression, depression doesn't have a cure. They may feel frustrated when they have a terrible day. Some may recover in a few weeks, but each person is different. Staying in touch and checking in with them regularly says you are thinking about them. Keep lines of communication open when you don't meet in person. Send a text or call them to see how they are doing or ask if they need anything. Your actions help maintain the relationship. You may find yourself doing more communicating and reaching out, which is fine. Symptoms of depression, such as withdrawal from others and lack of communication, may still be a concern but continue providing support to keep them encouraged. Educate Yourself About Depression And Different Forms Of It Learn about symptoms of depression and how they affect daily living. Because depression affects people differently, it is essential to understand the symptoms, different types, and how people cope. A 2017 study estimated over 17 million American adults have major depression or experienced a major depressive episode. Educating yourself helps you understand more about how depression symptoms affect your friend. Ask them about the symptoms and what they do when they occur. Educate yourself about diagnosis, treatments, and potential causes. Gaining this essential knowledge will help you have in-depth discussions with your friend. As you learn more about depression, depression has different forms besides low mood and sadness. A depressed person may express anger, irritability, have problems sleeping, and issues with memory and confusion. Some have trouble staying focused. Others may have physical symptoms like aches, pains, or an upset stomach. Some with major depression may experience more severity in their symptoms. Your friend may feel exhausted or be in a bad mood more often. When they express their discomfort, show empathy, and let them know you'll help them with anything they need. Practice Self-Care And Set Boundaries Taking care of yourself is essential, especially when getting caught up helping someone else. Helping someone you care about cope with their depression symptoms burns energy. It is common to worry about someone you care for, but remember to continue meeting your needs. Balance out your energy to avoid burnout and frustration. If you are not taking care of yourself, you won't be helpful to your friend. Wanting to help your friend is great, but have boundaries in place. Let your friend know the best time to call you or when it is best to get in touch with you, especially if they need to talk. You could have a plan in place that includes using a code or text if they are in a crisis. You could get your friend involved by rotating when to reach out or provide assistance. Learn The Best Ways To Help Loved Ones Cope With DepressionSpeak With A Therapist Online As you practice self-care, think about activities and things you like to do that can help you recharge. Emotionally, helping a depressed friend could have a toll on you, and such activities help maintain your mental health. Things You Should Avoid If your friend seems moody toward you, don't take it personally. Their depression symptoms are not their fault, nor are they yours. You may feel frustrated or upset if they continue isolating themselves when you try to include them in plans or if they don't follow up with you. You may feel like you need space, and that is okay. Avoid placing blame toward them or saying anything that could influence their negative feelings. Depression symptoms require treatment from a mental health professional. Avoid trying to fix their emotions. You may not have a clear picture of what they are going through. Be mindful of how you use your words when intending to help them feel better. Maintaining positive support lets your friend know they matter to you. You can be a positive influence by reminding them of why you value your friendship and what you like about them. Some suggest avoiding giving advice, even if you have good ideas like exercising or eating healthy. Your friend may not be interested to hear it yet. Be a listener until they show an interest in wanting to learn more. Avoid comparing their experience to others. Sometimes claiming you understand, when you don't, may not do much to help your friend or their mood. Focus on what they are feeling at the moment. It validates what they are experiencing. Avoid recommending they should take medication. People with major depression may take medication to help manage their symptoms. For some people, it works, and for others, it doesn't. It is considered a personal choice. Even if you don't believe in taking it, try to avoid the subject. Know When to Step In A person with major depression may feel unworthy, hopeless, and extreme sadness. Sometimes such feelings may lead to self-harm. It is essential to recognize potential warning signs of someone who may engage in self-injury or attempt to take their life. If you feel your friend is in crisis, encourage them to call their doctor, therapist, the Crisis Text Line by texting ""HOME"" to 741741, or the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (800-273-8255). Tell your friend you'll call for them if they want you to. Since many people live with depression, depression episodes vary from person to person. Understanding how to help your friend cope includes being a good listener, providing moral support, and letting them know you'll be there for them. People with major depression are likely to isolate and withdraw from people that care about them. You can play a valuable role in encouraging your friend to stay productive while they cope.",2022-08-01,Coping strategies
How To Recognize And Manage Sources Of Depression,BetterHelp,"An episode of depression can occur suddenly, even when things in life seem fine. While depression has potential causes, understanding what triggers it is vital to maintaining good mental health. An episode may leave you feeling tired, unworthy, and make things more challenging to complete. When you can spot signs of depression within yourself, it raises awareness of the status of your mental health, and you can identify depression in others. Learn Strategies To Manage Your Depression Triggers With TherapyJoin BetterHelp To Get Started Assess Recent Thoughts And Actions Assessing your mental health is essential when determining possible triggers. Think about thoughts and actions that led to you feeling depressed. Sometimes people get so busy living day to day they may not realize a situation or circumstance triggered their depressive mood. Things around you, such as people, places, ideas, and events, all influence your mental health differently. Journal writing may help with getting things off your chest or reflecting on previous occasions. If you keep a mental health journal, review your past entries for clues. Maybe you'll notice a change in your mood or thoughts that could be a starting point for your assessment. Some may not find a cause for their depressive mood. Sometimes things that are out of your control is the culprit. Get To Know Common Triggers When living with depression, it is essential to understand possible triggers. People with a history of depression are more likely to experience another episode. Sometimes living situations with a family member or things going on at work may lead to feeling depressed. For some, the feeling may be gradual, which is why some may not recognize depression is settling in. Common depression triggers include the following: Life changes: A life transition can affect your mood, even if the change is positive. Life is about change, but depression can make it challenging to accept when you've gotten comfortable with the way things were before the change. At times, a life transition can have a dramatic effect on a person's mental health. Sometimes transitions are stressful and take time to adjust. Maybe you're getting used to a new job, working with new people, or living in a different neighborhood.  Physical changes such as menopause or learning about a medical condition that will alter your daily routine may bring depressive symptoms. An unexpected change, such as a loss of any kind, can be as difficult if not more as a positive change. Feeling Stressed And Overwhelmed: Many people live a stressful life. Stress is commonly experienced in different forms, and it can have a significant effect on your mental health. Whether you are dealing with pressure from your job, family, or relationships, it can take a toll on you mentally and physically. A mental health study shows evidence that many people with depression experience hormone changes due to stress.  Newly Diagnosed Medical Condition Or Illness: Different medical conditions may contribute to feeling depressed. Receiving news of diagnosis or even medicines used to treat the condition may trigger depressive symptoms. Your mental health may be a contributing factor to your recovery. Patients are encouraged to talk with their doctors about medication concerns, including side effects. Financial Issues: A common trigger that may lead to depression is money problems. It is also common among people experiencing substance use.  There are different ways money affects a person's situation. People earning low income may struggle to provide for their families. Those making more may struggle with meeting financial obligations or feel they need to achieve a particular lifestyle to be accepted by others. People may experience a reduction in income or sudden financial loss that could set in motion a depression cycle. Job Loss: It is challenging to grasp the concept of losing your job, especially if you've had it for many years. Losing your job may bring a lot of stress and uncertainty. When you have bills piling up, a family to take care of, or even a medical condition, the situation may seem unbearable. Even the thought of starting a new career path may seem daunting, but it depends on how you look at it. It may be an opportunity to go after something you've always wanted to do. Weight Changes: It is common for people to put on weight as they get older, but some may not realize how their eating habits have changed. If your lifestyle has changed or you're going through a life transition, your diet may be affected. A person with depression may become more self-conscious about their weight and appearance. Such thoughts can hurt your mental health. Eating less is also a trigger, with many not having an appetite when their emotions are low. Poor Eating Habits: Poor dieting may affect your mental health and trigger depression when your body isn't getting essential nutrients. Some people may find it difficult to eat proper meals daily or have other people they care for while putting someone else's needs before their own. A busy lifestyle that leaves little time to sit and enjoy a meal may trigger depressive moods. A diet high in sugar or carbs may give you energy temporarily, but without the right balance of nutrients, you're left feeling tired quickly. Learn Strategies To Manage Your Depression Triggers With TherapyJoin BetterHelp To Get Started Substance Overuse: Abusing substances such as alcohol or drugs may not only trigger depression but put your mental health in jeopardy. People may drink alcohol to lift their spirits, but the feeling is short-lived. Substance use involves developing a dependency on alcohol, drugs, or both. The situation is more complicated when a person doesn't recognize they have an addiction or won't admit to it. Not knowing that substance use can make depression worse. Lack Of Sex: Whether you have good relations with your partner or spouse, a lack of sexual interest may trigger your depression. You may want to consider ruling out other circumstances, such as medical problems or physical health concerns. Sometimes antidepressant medications may have this as a side effect. People with a history of substance overuse may experience issues with sexual performance. You can review concerns with your doctor or ask about changing your medication, so your mental health continues in the right direction. Lack Of Sleep: When you get little sleep, it affects your mental health. Many feel fatigued, have problems concentrating, and tend to be more moody than usual. Maintaining a regular sleep schedule is beneficial to your mental health and may help prevent symptoms from getting worse. Talking with your doctor or therapist may help with gaining other solutions to help you sleep better at night. Sleep disorders are common in people with substance use disorder. Rumination: Dwelling on pain or sorrow from an event is detrimental to your mental health. Sometimes people do this and exaggerate the situation. It could lead to negative actions such as substance use. Others may develop an obsession that makes daily living difficult. Rumination is a trigger because it may impair how a person's emotions respond to an event or circumstance. It is normal to experience sadness and grief in life, but some need additional support to handle such scenarios to have realistic expectations beyond their pain.

Once you are aware of what triggers your depression, you can determine the next steps toward a solution. Even though you may not be in control of how triggers occur, you can take action to reduce its emotional effects.  Managing your triggers may require guidance from your doctor or mental health specialist. While you may have a general idea of how your symptoms develop, working with a mental health expert puts them into perspective to learn from them. Some triggers may have a more substantial effect on your mental health than others.

Consider learning fun and interesting methods to help you cope instead of turning to alcohol or drugs to reduce substance overuse. Create a plan to prevent or avoid triggers. It may include noting which triggers are most likely to influence symptoms. You can talk to your mental health specialist to get additional guidance.

There are options to participate in an online therapy session where you can talk about your thoughts and feelings about depression, substance use, and more. These sessions are private and confidential, so you can open up and share what you are feeling with an understanding expert that wants to help.  People with a previous history of a mental health concern or substance use problem are likely to experience a relapse. Symptoms may return when actions or changes in your life trigger them.

How Do You Know If You Have Depression: 11 Hidden Signs and How to Manage Them,BetterHelp,"A person may be depressed and purposely choose to hide it from others, or they may not realize they are depressed.

The figures are similar the other way around, with those having a mood disorder also likely to have a substance or alcohol disorder.  Smiling Depression  Do you feel like you have to put on a happy face to get through the day? People hiding their depression may force a smile on their face when around others. Also known as ""smiling depression,"" a person may carry on as if nothing is wrong. They may worry about what other people think about them or think people may see them as unreliable. Some that force a smile at times could have significant depression. Some may recognize they need help but are not sure how to get it.  Tiredness Or Fatigue  Do you feel tired or exhausted more often? One of the most common signs of depression is fatigue. When you lack energy, you'll feel tired or worn out. You may feel this way if you're not getting enough sleep. Others may be burned out from work or family. While most people feel tired from time to time, a person with depression may feel fatigued persistently or develop severe tiredness.  Aches And Pains  Do you have aches or pains that come and go without a cause? Depression affects your mental health, but people experience physical consequences. Besides weight changes and tiredness, a person may experience headaches, backaches, digestion issues, and chronic pain. Some with major depression may experience other health concerns such as heart disease, arthritis, or type 2 diabetes. If you have a preexisting or chronic condition, depression makes taking care of yourself more challenging.  Pessimistic Thoughts  Do you have a habit of looking at things from a negative standpoint? Some with depression may have a difficult time thinking positively about the future. An individual with depression may assume their judgment is more accurate than someone who may not have depression. In short, they may not have as much optimism as others.  Irritability  Do you feel bothered by others during the day or seem uneasy? Changes in mood are common with depression, but many may not associate it with depression. Some who are depressed may express irritability or anger instead of sadness. Some may show a form of suppressed anger or show a sudden change in their mood, giving the impression they don't want to be bothered. Noticing The Hidden Signs Of Depression In Your Life?Combat Depression With Online Therapy  Loss Of Interest In Activities  Have you stopped doing an activity you loved? When living with depression, depression makes it almost impossible to engage in interesting activities or hobbies. Lack of interest in hobbies is a common symptom, especially when a person becomes distant and doesn't want to be around others. Activities once enjoyed are enjoyed no more.  Changes In Sex Drive  Do you look forward to being intimate with your partner? A person may not find sex as enjoyable if they are depressed. Other factors such as low energy, feeling tired often, and lack of interest may also contribute to the issue. A person with depression may have relationship and communication issues with their spouse or partner, adding additional strain to the situation. Why Does Depression Happen? Many people living with depression question why they feel this way and want to know what is behind their sadness. Researchers are trying to understand why depression occurs. Various potential causes and risk factors may contribute to the onset of symptoms. As we learn more about depression, depression symptoms may occur for reasons such as:  Stress or trauma. Life changes, unexpected loss, feeling burned out, or overwhelmed are changes that may trigger depressive episodes. Hormone changes or imbalance. Women may experience postpartum depression after childbirth due to body changes. Menopause and menstruation are other situations that may include hormonal imbalance. Family genes. A person may have depression if there is a family history or be at risk of developing it if it runs in their immediate family. Chemical differences. Physical or biological imbalances in the brain may increase the chances of developing depression. Medical conditions or illness. Certain medications, physical or mental conditions could increase depression risk.  What Can You Do If You Have Hidden Depression?

Foods That Fight Depression: Add These 12 Things To Your Diet,BetterHelp,"If you're struggling with depression and anxiety, you may be surprised to discover that your diet can make an impact on your mental illness. While changing your diet might not wholly heal your depression, focusing on nutrition can make a positive influence on mental health. It is always important to discuss treatment options with your counselor or mental health professional. Still, the use of food to fight depression has been studied and proven in various cases. Food Is One Way To Fight Depression - Therapy Is AnotherOvercome Depression With Online Therapy Can Food Fight Depression? Food, itself, does not fight depression. However, specific nutrients play a role in not only treating depression but preventing it, too. In fact, of all the nutrients in foods, there are 12 that seem to make a difference in major depressive disorder and other mental illnesses. The 12 nutrients that can help include:  Omega-3 Fatty Acids Vitamin A Vitamin B6 Vitamin B12 Vitamin C Iron Folate Magnesium Potassium Selenium Thiamine Zinc  By making it a point to add these components to your diet, those struggling with major depression, anxiety disorders, or other types of mental illness might see some improvement. What foods should be eaten to include these 12 nutrients? A varied diet consisting of fruits and vegetables, lean protein, and other healthy items can help you to get the nutrients required. The results of a study published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that a diet high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fish could decrease the risk of depression. Additionally, avoiding sugary foods and other types of junk food can play a key role in mental wellness. In another study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, researchers found that a diet high in added sugar can be a risk factor for depression. Identifying a few items rich in each nutrient category might help you to plan out your meals more effectively for fighting depression and anxiety. Essential Nutrients You Can Get From Food Foods Rich In Omega-3 Fatty Acids Omega-3 fatty acids are most commonly found in fish. Fish high in this nutrient include mackerel, salmon, sardines, and cod liver oil. This nutrient can also be found in flaxseed, chia seeds, and hemp seeds. Seaweed and algae are other options, though less common. Walnuts and kidney beans are also great options. With such variety, getting enough omega-3 fatty acids in your diet shouldn't be too difficult. If you find it hard to consume these foods, fish oil can be purchased in pill form and ensures that you get the nutrients necessary to fight depression and anxiety. Popular Options For Vitamin A The human body doesn't produce Vitamin A, so it's essential to consume the nutrient in your regular diet. Many sources can be eaten to get the proper amount of Vitamin A to effectively assist in fighting depression in all its forms. Egg yolks and milk are common foods that contain this nutrient. Fruit and vegetable options include a variety of squashes, spinach, carrots, sweet potatoes, mangoes, and papayas. While these foods are essential for Vitamin A consumption, overcooking these items can decrease the nutritional value. Ensure proper cooking to gain the most from these foods. Vitamin B6 Food Choices Vitamin B6 is present in a large number of foods but is far more potent in some foods than others. For example, chickpeas and beef liver have more than double the amount of Vitamin B6 than turkey or boiled potatoes. However, each of these food items is considered to be a rich source of the nutrient. Those looking to increase their B6 intake can also eat tuna, salmon, or chicken breast. Non-meat or fish options include bananas, onions, cottage cheese, rice, sunflower seeds, and raisins. Vitamin B6 can also be found in a supplement form at your local pharmacy or grocery store. Foods With Vitamin B12 Vitamin B12, along with other B vitamins, is essential for the best neurological function as it helps protect brain cells. It's a nutrient that is mostly found in animal products, including eggs, milk, fish, and meat. The foods with the highest levels of B12 are clams, beef liver, trout, salmon, beef, yogurt, and cheese. Vegetarians often find their source of B12 in fortified breakfast cereals. Vitamin B12 can also be consumed in pill form, added to the body via patches, or even injected when prescribed by a doctor. Vitamin C Rich Foods Vitamin C is great for boosting the immune system and has been shown to fight fatigue and improve mood. People often believe that Vitamin C is highest in oranges. Although oranges are high in Vitamin C, several foods contain more than the citrus fruit. Chili peppers, bell peppers, kale, and broccoli contain a large amount of Vitamin C. Other foods higher in the nutrient than oranges are papaya, brussel sprouts, cauliflower, strawberries, kiwi, mango, and pineapple. Drinking orange juice is a great way to increase your Vitamin C intake, but if you wish to go the juice route, consider pineapple juice, mango juice, or even strawberry-kiwi juice. Foods Rich In Iron Iron can be found in a large number of food sources, many higher than others. In fact, there are two kinds of iron: heme and non-heme. Where heme iron is absorbed up to 30%, non-heme iron is absorbed by the human body in amounts of or less than 10%. Heme iron comes from animal sources, and non-heme comes from plant-based sources. Foods rich in heme iron are beef, lamb, shrimp, clams, tuna, and eggs. Those with high levels of non-heme iron include spinach, sweet potatoes, peas, strawberries, watermelon, and beans. A diet with a variety of each kind of iron will help the body to absorb everything it needs. What To Eat For Folate Consumption Folate, also known as folic acid, is a nutrient that is necessary for brain development. It is often the focus of a pregnant woman's diet and is believed to play a role in preventing mental health issues. Foods that contain a lot of folates are dark green, leafy vegetables like romaine lettuce, asparagus, and spinach. Other options include beans, eggs, peanuts, and fresh fruits. Whole grains and seafood also contain good amounts of this nutrient. If you find yourself unable to consume enough of this nutrient from food sources, it is commonly consumed via supplements.  Best Things To Eat For Magnesium Banana, raspberries, avocado, spinach, kale, nuts, peas, broccoli, cabbage, and salmon are foods that contain a good amount of magnesium. Dark chocolate is a treat that also contains high levels of this nutrient. A magnesium-rich smoothie, such as one containing kale, banana, raspberries, avocado, and nut butter, can help you to increase your intake quickly. A shake containing these items would also serve to increase other necessary nutrients. Potassium Rich Foods What foods might you eat to increase your potassium intake? Some of the richest foods in potassium include apricots, bananas, oranges, a variety of beans, spinach, sweet potatoes, zucchini, yogurt, and salmon. Studies have shown that potassium deficiency can add to mental fatigue, serving to worsen depression and its symptoms. Consuming a healthy amount of potassium throughout the day will help to improve your mental health. Foods High In Selenium A study published in the journal Biological Psychiatry, found a link between decreased levels of selenium and low mood, fatigue, and anxiety. Many of the best foods for selenium are dairy and whole-grain products. For example, milk, yogurt, and fortified breakfast cereals are excellent sources of selenium. A hearty bowl of cereal in the morning can serve to provide you with a large amount of the necessary nutrients to help with your mental health. Other foods to consider are chicken, turkey, beef, shellfish, brazil nuts, and brown rice. It is important to consider eating the proper amount of selenium, but be sure that you do not eat too much. Too much selenium can have a negative effect on the body. How To Get Enough Thiamine Thiamine, or Vitamin B1, is found in whole grains, fish, and various meats. This is a nutrient that can be lost by overcooking food items, so the foods must be cooked to an appropriate temperature to avoid losing nutritional value. White rice, egg noodles, English muffins, and whole wheat macaroni contain high levels of Thiamine. Fish such as trout and tuna also serve as good sources of this nutrient. Meats that are high in Thiamine are pork and beef. A diet that includes each of these components is sure to be a diet with plenty of thiamine. Zinc In Food Zinc is found in a wide array of food sources, from pumpkin seeds to oysters and beef to chickpeas. It's also found in oatmeal, peas, baked beans, dark meat chicken, pork, yogurt, and milk. There are also supplements available over the counter for this nutrient. A zinc deficiency has also been found to be the cause of numerous psychological disorders and problems. By focusing on increasing zinc intake, people with depression may notice a positive change in both your depression and anxiety. Food Is One Way To Fight Depression - Therapy Is AnotherOvercome Depression With Online Therapy Using Food To Improve Mental Health What you consume and how you feel are two correlating factors. Food fuels your brain, so it makes sense that what you eat has an impact on your mental health. By making an effort to regulate your nutritionâ€”eating fewer processed foods and more nutrient-rich foodsâ€”you may discover that your depression symptoms are far more manageable. If you have doubts, talk to your mental health professional to discover how a specific diet might fit into your treatment plan. While decreasing your sugar intake may also prove to have a positive effect on your mental health, adding healthy options is likely easier than you might think. The use of smoothies, creative recipes, and other tricks can help you to get the necessary nutrients for a real change. Try cooking for friends and family members or meal-prepping for the week ahead to keep yourself accountable. If you still struggle with consuming the right kinds of nutrients, taking vitamins and supplements for these components can be a help. It's also important to remember that, while a well-balanced diet can provide many benefits, if you are struggling with depression, changing your diet alone may not provide the change needed compared to more thorough forms of treatment. If you are experiencing the symptoms of depression, always seek professional help for advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Some questions you can ask your therapist to learn more include: What foods increase happiness? There are a variety of foods that can improve mood and decrease depression. For example, protein-rich foods (eggs, cottage cheese, poultry, Greek yogurt) have been shown to alleviate depression symptoms. Also, foods high in the amino acid GABA, which has a calming effect, can help with symptoms of depression and anxiety. Some foods high in GABA include beans, brown rice, cruciferous vegetables, and mushrooms. There is also evidence that foods high in carotenoids like beta-carotene, such as leafy greens, carrots, tomatoes, cantaloupe, and squash, can decrease depression. Additionally, foods that contain certain essential fatty acids, such as alpha-linolenic acid, could help alleviate symptoms of depression. What vitamin deficiency can cause depression? Research shows that there is a connection between a lack of vitamin D and depression symptoms. One study found that taking a vitamin D supplement may help those with major depression. A lack of vitamin B12, zinc, and folate can also lead to symptoms of depression. What is the best diet for mental health? The best diet for improved mental wellbeing is going to depend on the individual and the specific mental health concerns they're living with. You may have friends or family members who have tried a Mediterranean dietâ€”which is high in lean protein, fruit, legumes, and vegetablesâ€”and reported an improvement in their mental health. For those dealing with substance use disorders, a diet that supplements nutrients that may be affected by substance abuse could be best. For example, alcohol overuse can impact levels of vitamins A and B6, so eating foods that are high in those vitamins may improve both physical and mental health. Diet is not meant to replace more thorough forms of treatment for substance use disorders, such as stays in treatment facilities or therapy. To find treatment facilities near you, you can utilize the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's Treatment Services Locator.",2022-09-04,Self care
Highs And Lows: Understanding Symptoms Of Manic Depression,BetterHelp,"Depending on your age and the company you keep, you might not have heard much about manic depression lately. However, it's still out there â€“ it's just more commonly referred to as ""bipolar disorder"" these days. While most of us hear quite a bit about bipolar disorder on advertisements or see representations of it in the media, it's hard to know what the condition really feels like. This is particularly worrying if you think that you or someone that you care about might have it. Generally, the symptoms of bipolar disorder are mood shifts between depressive episodes and manic episodes. But there's more to it than that. Let's take a closer look. Causes Of Manic Episodes Learn How to Navigate The Highs And Lows Of Manic DepressionMatch With A Therapist Who Can Help Your brain works through a series of chemical messengers called neurotransmitters. There are two main classes of neurotransmitters, namely stimulants and depressants. When your brain chemistry shifts in favor of stimulants over depressants, it can trigger a manic episode. This happens for some reasons that we'll discuss more deeply throughout the article. Conditions like bipolar disorder are the most common, though stress, substance use, and in some cases, seasonal change can also cause manic episodes. If your healthcare provider determines that a mental health condition is causing your manic episodes, he or she may prescribe prescription medication. Most of these prescription medications work by balancing your brain chemistry to limit episodes or reduce their severity. There are some things that you can do to help to manage manic episodes without medication, including diet and lifestyle changes. Some people also find that counseling or talk therapy helps them to recognize and manage their manic episodes. However, if your manic episodes are caused by a mental health condition like bipolar disorder, these measures may not be enough on their own. Depression And Mania Depression and mania are conditions that we can look at as opposites â€“ with both being bad. People experiencing depression may feel a low mood, lack of energy, or apathy. People experiencing mania may feel high energy, inability to focus, and may experience anxiety or trouble sleeping. Both mania and depression can be experienced by people with conditions other than a bipolar disorder â€“ or by people with no condition at all. For example, depressive episodes can be triggered by an event like the loss of a loved one or losing a job. Manic episodes can be caused by elevated stress. Both can be caused by situations that combine stress and a feeling of loss, like moving to a new town. Few people experience depression and mania regularly. For most people, particularly people with bipolar disorder, they are experienced as isolated ""episodes."" How an individual experiences these episodes can vary drastically, however manic episodes tend to be relatively short (a few days). In contrast, depressive episodes can be comparatively long (two weeks or more). Depressive Episodes As mentioned above, depressive episodes can last for weeks or even months. They are characterized by low mood, lack of energy. However, depression can also come with physical symptoms, including trouble maintaining a healthy weight and disturbances in sleep patterns.  People may experience depressive episodes without having bipolar disorder due to a variety of other contributing factors, including life events, age, and other depressive disorders, including seasonal affective disorder. Manic Episodes Manic episodes are typically shorter than depressive episodes. During a manic episode, people usually experience high energy, but they may also have difficulty focusing, or experience anxiety. Physical symptoms often include decreased appetite and trouble sleeping. People experiencing a manic episode may also engage in uncharacteristic or irrational and impulsive behavior. While it is rare, people can experience manic episodes without having bipolar disorder. Other conditions that can cause manic episodes to include sudden lifestyle changes, conditions that cause prolonged disrupted sleep patterns, substance abuse, and a rare psychological condition called hypomania. Mixed Episodes While people without bipolar disorder can experience depressive and manic episodes, mixed episodes are unique to bipolar disorders. In fact, they're so unusual that not even all people that have bipolar disorder experience them. During a mixed episode, the individual may feel the urge to do things but lack the physical energy. Alternatively, they may experience high energy but not know what to do. Manic Episodes As A Result Of Bipolar Disorder Bipolar disorder is characterized by a shifting back-and-forth between manic episodes and depressive episodes. Unfortunately, bipolar disorder implies that there is a ""normal"" somewhere in the middle. While some people with bipolar disorder can recognize this normal in themselves, other people see the shift back and forth between mania and depression as normal for them. As a result, some people who live their entire lives with bipolar disorder â€“ notably milder cases â€“ may not realize that they have the condition because it feels normal for them. Just because something feels normal doesn't mean that it is healthy. People who undergo treatment for bipolar disorder often find it easier to do things like maintain relationships and keep steady employment. We've already talked about the symptoms of bipolar disorder, but it may make sense to talk about how to notice these symptoms on yourself. After that, we'll talk about how to manage them and when it's time to seek help. Noticing Symptoms Learn How to Navigate The Highs And Lows Of Manic DepressionMatch With A Therapist Who Can Help One great way to notice symptoms of bipolar disorder is to keep a diary. The more specific, the better. When you keep track of your feelings over time, it's easier to notice patterns. If you're not much of a writer or don't think that you'll be able to manage to keep a diary during a depressive episode, just make a mark on your calendar for days when you feel that you might be depressed and a different mark for days when you think that you might be manic. Don't worry if you aren't sure â€“ if you decide to pursue treatment options, your care providers will help you figure things out. If you're more of a number's person, keeping track of your finances can be an excellent way to quantify your moods. This was a thing that people used to do automatically when more of us used checkbooks. In this digital age, you can take your spending for granted if you don't regularly itemize your expenses. So, start looking at the line items on your credit and debit cards, and even keeping receipts. Did you spend the usual amount on delivery one week and make any unusual big-ticket purchases the next week? This can be a significant indication that you might have bipolar disorder. Or that someone might have stolen your credit card. Maintaining close relationships can be a good way of finding out that you might have a bipolar disorder from other people. Because our minds tend to ignore their own thought processes â€“ a trend that we'll return to in the next section â€“ it can be hard to notice unusual behaviors in ourselves. Other people can be much more perceptive to when we might be acting strangely â€“ provided that we are fairly open with them fairly regularly. This is another idea that we'll return to in a moment. Managing Manic Episodes Some of the best ways to manage manic episodes are the same as the ways to identify them. Maintaining close personal contacts with people can help you to stabilize your mood. If you live with a close friend or family members like a spouse, sibling, parent, or adult child, consider asking them to help monitor your behavior during manic episodes. This can help to reduce things like impulsive purchases. Practicing good sleep hygiene can also help you to manage some of the physical impacts of manic episodes. Poor or disrupted sleeping patterns can both cause and worsen manic episodes, so doing things like trying to stick to a consistent schedule can help you to have fewer manic episodes and to make sure that the episodes that you do have take as small a toll as possible on your body. Trying to use stimulants like caffeine in moderation can also help to limit manic episodes. During manic episodes, you may want to cut back even further, or even avoid caffeine altogether. Remember the neurotransmitters that we were talking about above? Caffeine works by clogging receptors that normally allow depressants to slow you down, tipping the balance in your brain in favor of stimulants. A little coffee can be a good way to start your day, but too much can kick start â€“ or aggravate -a manic episode. Finally, we mentioned above that our thoughts and feelings can easily get away from us. This can allow manic episodes to catch us by surprise and prevent us from living our best lives when they catch up with us. Mindfulness is a practice that helps to train us to be more in touch with our thoughts and feelings. Practicing mindfulness between episodes can help to alert you to when an episode might be coming on. Practicing mindfulness during an episode can help to minimize stress and keep you from making decisions that you'll regret later.  When To Look For Help A recurring theme through this article is determining when mood changes are the natural ebb-and-flow of life and when they're symptoms of bipolar disorder. So, how can you tell the difference? Thankfully, it's not all up to you. To get medication for bipolar disorder and to make counseling and therapy more affordable, you'll need a diagnosis. That usually comes from your primary care provider. If you feel like your life is a constant swing between unmanageable lows and uncontrollable highs, talk to your care provider. They can help to determine whether you have bipolar disorder and what the best way to manage it is. Whether you're working through the diagnosis process with your care provider or looking to stabilize your own emotions without a diagnosis, talking to a therapist or counselor through an online platform can be a good first step. It's convenient and personal, as well as more affordable for those paying without the help of an insurance provider.

Moving Forward Whether or not you have bipolar disorder, managing emotions can feel like a full-time job in today's hectic world. There are a couple of things that you can do on your own to control your feelings, but if this proves too much for you, there's nothing wrong with seeking professional help.

Do Adults Experience Multiple Levels Of Depression?,BetterHelp,"Depression is a mental health disorder that can have a massive impact on an individual's life. While a depressive disorder differs from a depressed mood, some shared symptoms can make depression hard to diagnose. Understanding the symptoms of both the disorder and feeling depressed and the various levels of depression can help to identify the best course of action for treatment. Adults are capable of feeling depressed just as they can have a depressive disorder. Treatment, commonly with counseling, can help individuals to feel more like themselves again. However, until a diagnosis has been made,, and an effort is put into healing, depression can reach worsening levels. What's The Difference Between Feeling Depressed And Depression? Depression Is Tricky, But You Can Learn to Manage It Healthily Get Guidance From A Licensed Therapist Depression and other depressive disorders often include feeling sad or depressed, in the list of symptoms. What is the difference between a feeling of sadness and depression and an actual depressive disorder? There are a few factors that turn feeling sad into having depression. For one, an individual experiencing depression has likely been in a depressive mood for months. This is not to say that they can never experience a sliver of happiness during that time, but it does mean that they have been sad more than anything else. A person that has a depressive disorder also tends to experience a loss of interest in the things they once enjoyed. When this symptom is coupled with the feeling of sadness over an extended period, depression is the likely cause. Those with a depressive disorder may also notice a change in their weight, appetite, and sleeping habits. Although the difference between feeling sad and having a diagnosable depression can be spotted by keying into the symptoms, there are also three different levels of depression that should be identified. Chronic Depression As Mild Depression Chronic depression, also known as dysthymia or persistent depressive disorder, is a mild form of depression that often exhibits fewer symptoms than other forms of depressive disorders. Although symptoms are fewer, the time in which an individual experience them is usually longer. Typically, a patient with chronic depression displays symptoms for more than two years. Symptoms can disappear temporarily, but a person with this form of depression does not get a break from symptoms for more than two months at a time. Chronic Depression Symptoms To Lookout For The symptoms for chronic depression are very similar to that of many other depressive disorders. The main difference lies in the intensity and the time a person has to deal with them. Those diagnosed with chronic depression may see one or more of the following:  Feelings of sadness, low self-esteem, and/ or guilt Fatigue and an overall sense of low energy Inability to concentrate Little to no interest in formerly enjoyed activities and events A noticeable change in diet Feeling irrationally irritable or angry Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much  It's unlikely that a patient with chronic depression is experiencing every symptom at once. However, they may notice that each of the symptoms makes an appearance over time. It is also possible that only a few symptoms have been present. Because of the less intense nature of the symptoms, this level of depression is often harder to diagnose than more severe forms. Treatment Options For Chronic Depression  When a diagnosis has been made, various treatment options are available to those with chronic depression. Psychotherapy and medication are the two most common forms of treatment. In most cases, a mental health professional will recommend therapy prior to medication. Many practitioners will take your opinion into consideration when determining the best treatment. For example, if you wish to avoid medication, they will likely steer you toward counseling or therapy. Therapy is effective when it comes to various forms of depression because it aims to teach patients how to handle their thoughts healthily. It also serves as a tool to help individuals to change how they think. Instead of focusing on the negative parts, a therapist can help you to see the positive light. However, there are some ways that medication can help that makes it valuable. Despite the potential side effects of medication, the benefits outweigh the possibility of an adverse reaction for many patients. If you and your mental health professional decide to opt for medication, you must use it as directed. Missing doses or stopping the medication without your doctor's consent can lead to dangerous results. Antidepressants aim to diminish the symptoms of depression, so when the medication is halted too quickly, those symptoms can come back in full force. Always discuss medication changes or treatment options with your mental health provider before making any decisions. Major Depressive Disorder Or Clinical Depression Major depressive disorder, also known as clinical depression, is a severe form of depression that can make a significant impact on your life. In most cases, major depression changes life in such a way that daily activities can feel impossible to complete. Whether its personal hygiene, household chores or spending time with family, major depression can make you feel as though you can't do anything. Some individuals can reach the point of suicide, so major depression must be treated quickly. If you think you may have a major depressive disorder, confirming some symptoms might encourage you to seek help. Clinical Depression Symptoms To Lookout For Many of the symptoms for major depressive disorder are the same as chronic depression. The difference, in most cases, is the level of intensity that an individual experiences the symptoms. Additionally, a person with major depression tends to encounter intense symptoms over a shorter period of time than those with chronic depression. Typically, this means longer than a few weeks but usually less than two years. Be on the lookout for the following symptoms: Depression Is Tricky, But You Can Learn to Manage It Healthily Get Guidance From A Licensed Therapist  Feelings of sadness, hopelessness, guilt, or anxiety Change in sleeping patterns, difficulty sleeping or sleeping too much Irritability, anger, and outbursts No longer interested in previously enjoyed activities Fatigue and an overall lack of energy Diminished appetite or increase in hunger Unintentional change in weight Inability to concentrate or think clearly Physical pains not attributed to other illness or injury Reoccurring thoughts of suicide or self-harm  If you are feeling any of the symptoms associated with significant depression, seeking help is imperative in healing and moving forward. Ask a mental health professional, your primary care doctor, or a trusted friend for help to begin seeking treatment. Treatment Options For Major Depression As with other forms of depression, the most common treatment options are therapy and medication. However, with the presence of major depression, it may be necessary for you to have a hospital stay for some time. There are also outpatient programs that can help you to get past the worst of the symptoms before seeing a therapist. Antidepressants are commonly used in conjunction with other treatments. If therapy is a treatment option that you desire to try, it may be easier to use modern forms of counseling. There are various ways to attend counseling or therapy sessions online or by phone. When it's too difficult to leave your home or if you're uncomfortable sitting in an office to talk, online therapy can offer a solution. Therapy through online messaging, emails, phone calls, and video chats can be just as effective as those in person. This is a decision that you may want to discuss with your doctor.  Your doctor may also recommend other forms of treatment. Exercise, exposure to sunlight, eating a healthy diet, and journaling are some common options that have helped depression patients in the past. Some people have found success in meditation, breathing techniques, and various stress-relieving activities. Finding the treatment that is best for you is reliant upon discussing all options with a mental health professional. If you find that your doctor is unreceptive to your ideas for treatment, see if another doctor is more willing to listen. Ultimately, you are the one that has to stick out the treatment plan. If you are not committed, you may not experience the results desired. Can Your Level Of Depression Change? Although you may have started with chronic depression, you may not stay on that level of depression forever. Without treatment, depression can always worsen. To get better, those going through any form of depression have to put in the effort to heal. Chronic depression can become a major depressive disorder, which means the less intense symptoms the patient once felt will become more severe and life-changing. Getting your life back starts with seeking help. When you've put forth the effort in therapy and used medication as directed, you may start to notice that you enjoy activities again. You can enjoy a baseball game, spend quality time with friends and family, and go to work as per usual. Life doesn't have to stay in the same depressive state, whether chronic or major depression is present. Get proper treatment and start living life again.

What Experts Say About Male Postpartum Depression,BetterHelp,"While the concept of male postpartum depression or paternal postpartum depression (PPPD) may at first be strange or surprising, the truth is that postpartum depression statistics show thousands of new fathers each year are suffering from its symptoms.  Incredibly stressful or emotional events can take a toll on the mental health of anyone, and it's important that those who are prone to depression or other mental health issues understand when they are at risk. Therapy Can Help You Overcome Male Postpartum DepressionDon at Do It Alone - Match With A Therapist  The emotion and stress following childbirth are immense for both parents, and we should avoid feeling the need to compare them to one another. Mental health is personal and unique to every individual. Any stressful or emotional event can trigger a major depressive episode in one who may be at risk. In this article, we are going to explore further the science behind paternal postpartum depression and the symptoms and treatments one can expect. By the end, you should both better understand this relatively new disorder and why we need to take its effects seriously. The Basics of Postpartum Depression As we touched on a bit in the intro, paternal postpartum depression is something that is still poorly understood by the general population. Since postpartum depression is associated with well-stated hormonal changes and the trauma associated with childbirth, we find it easy to understand that health consequences may follow for women. Society as a whole views the role in childbirth as passive, and therefore depression resulting from the event can seem unwarranted. The truth is that childbirth for the father can also be a very stressful experience, one that can also result in hormonal changes. Research has shown that men have decreases in testosterone and increases in depressive symptoms following childbirth. It is thought these hormonal changes may help a father form the parental bond with the new child. When testosterone goes down, the male is more prone to depression but might be more patient when dealing with a crying child. Hormonal changes in addition to the stresses of new fatherhood, for example, the lack of sleep, can take a substantial toll on one's mental health. If the new father has a history of depression, then there is a substantial risk that they may develop paternal postpartum depression. In summary, the combination of hormonal and non-hormonal stresses take a toll on mental health. Stresses that Can Help Trigger a Depressive Episode Some of these changes in lifestyle and added pressures can trigger a depressive episode.  Family Dynamics Will be Different  While the mother and child often bond immediately, it can take some time for a father and child to have the same bond. In some cases of PPD, resentment at the child may begin due to the attention the child derived from the family, and lack of affection it showed the father. This perceived slight, even if it seems irrational, can affect men on the subconscious level.    Pressures to Care and Provide  Knowing that you must care and provide for a family can be massive pressure to all of a sudden take upon yourself. This pressure can become a sizable mental burden. Many men tend to unconsciously retreat into work as both a way to fight against this worry and to relieve themselves of aspects of care they feel uncomfortable with.  A Lack of Sleep and of Sex  With a new baby, sexual activity and regular sleep are usually on hold. Regular sex life and regular sleep are two things that can affect many men significantly. In 2010 researchers from the Department of Pediatrics at Eastern Virginia Medical School found evidence of prenatal and postpartum depression in roughly 8-10% of men. When the mother is suffering from postpartum depression, the father has a higher risk of developing depression. When the father has a postpartum depression, the mother has a higher risk of developing depression. When either parent has symptoms of postpartum depression, the family unit suffers as a whole. We must take all signs of Postpartum Depression seriously for both parents in order to maintain optimal mental health for the whole family. How Postpartum Depression in Men Manifests No diagnosis is universally used for paternal postpartum depression, though most accept it occurs mainly 2-3 weeks after birth, it can happen up to a year after the event. Men are more likely than women to have symptoms that involve aggressiveness. Typical depression is often used as the baseline for diagnosing symptoms. Major Depression, regardless of the underlying cause, can be diagnosed if enough of the prescribed symptoms are readily apparent. The symptoms for major depression are generally described as:  Difficulty Concentrating  Depression often causes muddled or confused thoughts, and the inability to focus. Often the lack of sleep and chaos from having a new baby may mask these symptoms.  Guilt, Hopelessness, Sadness  Feeling sad or guilty can often be a result of paternal postpartum depression. Thoughts of death or suicide can also appear. These feelings can have many different causes but may be exacerbated by the circumstances of the new birth. If you are feeling suicidal, you should seek immediate help. These resources can help you. If  you or a loved one are experiencing suicidal thoughts, reach out for help immediately. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline can be reached at 1-800-273-8255 and is available to assist 24/7.  Changes in Weight and Sleep  Weight loss and weight gain are associated with depression as is sleeping excessively or having difficulty sleeping.  Loss of Pleasure  Loss of pleasure or enjoyment in activities and interests is a common sign of depression. This is noticeable when the person with depression stops participating in or enjoying all the things they did before the depression.  Aches or Pains  Depression and anxiety can cause pains and aches to appear in places that don't have any seeming reason to hurt. These aches and pains can then feed back into, and cause more depression and anxiety.  Lack of Energy  Feeling tired or lethargic can be symptoms of depression. These symptoms are often masked by the fact parents will be short on sleep with a new baby. Sleep can be challenging to obtain when you do get a chance. Therapy Can Help You Overcome Male Postpartum DepressionDon at Do It Alone - Match With A Therapist Below is a summarized version of an example case of PPD included in a study conducted by Dr. Jonathan R. Scarff. A new father in his thirties has had issues falling asleep for the last five months since his child was born. He is feeling lethargic, lacks energy, and can't work up the motivation to hang out with friends or exercise. He is beginning to feel more frustrated and having trouble focusing at work. He is more argumentative at work and at home. Weight gain and loneliness are increasing. Now with all of these symptoms, you have a good case for Paternal Postpartum Depression. Health experts will look to see if this father has a history, or family history, depression, or other mental health issues to screen for likely risks. As you can see, though, Paternal Postpartum Depression resembles your average father, who has become overwhelmed by the new responsibilities of parenting and is having issues coping with them all. It is easier to understand why experts believe that roughly 10% of men will have some related PPPD symptoms. Increased Risk Factors for Male PPD As we learn more about male postpartum depression and anxiety due to childbirth, we have begun to decipher what may help to cause the disorder. The following are the major risk factors for developing Paternal postpartum depression and anxiety:  Common Marital Discord or unhappiness Lower-income socioeconomic status Maternal PPD can be attributed to increased paternal PPD and vice-versa A personal or family history of depression Unintended pregnancies are correlated with higher PPPD rates Sleep deprivation or chronic lack of sleep  Common Treatments for PPD A doctor and professional counselor should always be your first steps if you feel you or a loved one has depression. In addition to professional help, there are a few things you can do at home that have been proven to help with depression. Work Out While a lack of energy and lethargy are common and can make working out hard, the process of exercise will fight to give you your energy levels back down the road. Men should make an effort to get a good workout a couple of times a week. Socialize Depression often makes you want to turn inwards. A new child will make one busy and unwilling to make an effort to leave home. However, connection to a support network for many people. Put aside time for family and friends; your brain needs it.  Sleep While this can be difficult to make time for, it is vital for good health. A lack of sleep is thought to be the most significant cause of the exacerbation of mental health issues. Figure out a system that allows a person suffering from depressive symptoms to get more sleep. Maybe the parents can take shifts for late-night feedings so that each parent gest rest. Don't Wait to Get Help If you believe that you or a loved one may be suffering from depression, no matter the cause, don't hesitate to reach out for professional help. Doctors and counselors are well trained to assist you with these common depressive issues. Whether you choose to seek in-person or online therapy (like BetterHelp), you are taking an important step forward to mental wellness. You don't have to deal with depression alone.",2022-08-01,Special Groups
Signs That You May Have Moderate Depression,BetterHelp,"Understanding the Signs and Symptoms of Moderate Depression Depression is a  common mental health condition and becoming an ever more widespread feature of our modern society. While the reasons and causes of depression are not fully understood, we are becoming increasingly more skilled at treating and identifying the various types of depression. Do You Want To Conquer Your Moderate Depression? Try Online Therapy With BetterHelp The National Institute of Mental Health estimates that 6.7% of U.S. adults had at least one major depressive episode in 2016. These numbers are expected to be significantly higher in 2020. Since the understanding of depression is continuously evolving, there are various classifications (some which now overlap) of depression. The type of depression often includes the severity of either mild, moderate, or severe and a descriptor of causes. Examples would include severe postpartum depression, or perhaps moderate seasonal affective disorder. In this article, we are going to be focusing on the typical symptoms of moderate Major Depression and what the current science has to tell us about it. By the end, you should be able to differentiate the various severities of depression and what they mean. What is Moderate Major Depression? While this phrasing may seem strange, diagnosable general depression is officially referred to as ""Major Depression"" in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSMâ€“5). The severity of symptoms is rated as mild, moderate, or severe. So when you have Moderate Major Depression, you have unspecified depression with moderate symptoms. Many of the symptoms and variations, as well as the severity of the types of depressions, may overlap. This is a complex disorder that lies upon a wide gradient. Being honest about feelings, symptoms, and the severity of each is crucial to a healthcare professional making the correct diagnosis. Even so, symptoms, their causes, and their severity can change and shift over time and with treatment. Depression Severity The common feature of all types of depression are feelings of sadness, irritability, and effects on one's capacity to function. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSMâ€“5) gives us these labels as a way to classify the severity of symptoms for a Depressive Disorder. Mild. Mild depression cases have just barely the number of symptoms required to make a diagnosis. The severity of symptoms is ""distressing but manageable"" and result in minor issues while working or socializing. Mild depression is noticeable, and is likely the most prevalent form in society, but is also the hardest to diagnose. People will often dismiss symptoms as standard or a general part of life. Even when sleep, weight, and work suffer, many people are hesitant to think they have a diagnosable issue. On the plus side, mild depression is also the most readily treatable. Meditation, yoga, exercise, a healthy diet, better sleep, all of these have been shown to help alleviate symptoms.  Moderate. The severity and number of symptoms for moderate cases will fall somewhere between mild and severe. The DSM-5 doesn't give much advice past that, and so leaves it up to the healthcare professional to make the final judgment. Moderate depression is more evident than mild cases but is not entirely hindering one's ability to function. Moderate depression more often requires the help of trained professionals and counselors. Severe. In severe cases, the symptoms and their severity are well above the threshold to make a diagnosis.  Symptoms cause significant distress and dramatically hamper one's ability to work or socialize. Severe depression requires immediate medical assistance. If you or a loved one is having an inability to work or function as expected, you must seek treatment. Mild or moderate depression may be harder to diagnose, but all warning signs should be taken seriously. Diagnosing Moderate Forms of Depression According to the DSM-5, when diagnosing depression, the patient has to display at least five of the listed symptoms (though this number changes a bit, depending on the specific depressive disorder). Depending on the number of symptoms and the severity of symptoms, you will get a diagnosis of either mild, moderate, or severe. For example, depression with anxious distress has five symptoms that are unique to it that differ from general symptoms of depression.  Feeling overexcited or tense. Feeling strangely restless. Trouble focusing because of worry. Fear that something bad might happen. Feeling that the person could lose control of themselves.  To specify the current severity as mild, one must exhibit at least two of these symptoms. Moderate requires three, and a diagnosis of severe depression with anxious distress requires four symptoms with motor agitation. Moderate Major Depression As stated before, when you have Moderate Major Depression, you have unspecified depression with moderate symptoms. Moderate symptoms are described as being above the minimum (you need at least five symptoms from the following list for a diagnosis) yet not as debilitating as causing you to be unable to work and socialize. The symptoms of depression are as follows:  Sad, depressed, empty mood for the majority of the day. Younger adults and teens may feel more irritable. This symptom is counted as being either self-described or as observed by others familiar with the depressed person. A lack of interest in having fun or partaking in pleasurable activities. This is also both up to one's own account or the observation of others familiar with the person in question. A significant change in weight without an effort for such change (not dieting or purposely putting on pounds). This is stated as roughly a 5% change in weight a month. A fluctuation of appetite. Having feelings of either insomnia or hypersomnia very often. Constant psychomotor agitation or retardation. Psychomotor retardation is a visible change, a slowing, in the emotional and physical reactions of someone. Psychomotor agitation is restlessness and anxiousness that can make someone make movements without having meant to. A lack of energy or a feeling of fatigue almost every day. Guilt that is unwarranted or a feeling of worthlessness. A hindered ability to think clearly or focus. An inability to make decisions. Conducting reckless behavior to numb the pain. Recurring thoughts of death or plans of suicide.  If you or someone you know is experiencing suicidal thoughts, help is available. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline can be reached at 1-800-273-8255 and is available 24/7, or you can text the word ""HOME"" to 741741 to reach the Crisis Text Line. For many with depression, it seems hard to imagine that treatment will help them feel better. The truth is, depression treatment has come very far in recent decades, and the sooner one gets treatment, the better their results will be. Do You Want To Conquer Your Moderate Depression? Try Online Therapy With BetterHelp Being diagnosed with depression requires one to be honest about symptoms, some of which may seem embarrassing or shameful. This is another place where the person going through it needs to understand how getting help may be required to improve their symptoms. Honesty is essential for proper treatment; this is why non-disclosure is an integral part of healthcare professionalism. No matter what you're feeling with depression, your feelings are valid. Depression is one of the most common mental disorders, and it's important to note that it is nothing to be ashamed of. Treatment for Moderate Depression While those with mild depression may be able to exercise and do other forms of various self-help to combat the condition, those with moderate depression may require more professional help. Mild to Moderate depression is often helped through talking therapies and trained counselors. Moderate to Severe depression often requires the assistance of antidepressants or combination therapy (antidepressants plus talking therapy). Those who have moderate to severe depression can often benefit from some forms of antidepressants though not everyone sees the same effects. In some cases, regular treatment may need to last years for one to overcome the majority of symptoms. You should consult with your primary care provider, doctor, or psychiatrist to discuss potential medication options. In other cases, mindfulness (meditation and related thought exercises) can have many of the same effects, allowing you to subdue the most harmful and uncontrolled of your thoughts. Exercise and diet in tandem with any treatment have shown to offer additional benefits and to maximize overall well-being. Being physically active can reduce stress, improve your mood, and allow your body to overall function better, thus allowing one to heal. Counselors, who play a larger role in helping moderate depression, work to assist you in understanding your behaviors and thoughts and what fuels them. An effort is made to help change the way you think about things, such as past traumas or excessive feelings. Mixed treatments have continued to improve their overall success rate significantly over time. Today online counseling (Online CBT) has been acknowledged by healthcare experts to be an effective and inexpensive option for those who cannot afford the time or money for trips to in-person counseling. Getting Help While our ability to treat depression is growing, so too are the number of cases. Depression is a growing issue in the modern world, and many forms of it (such as mild or moderate depression) can be challenging to detect. For those who are not comfortable with talking about their issues face to face, online counseling, such as BetterHelp, has been of enormous benefit.  The options for help are many. If you or a loved one experiences symptoms of depression, you should seek the proper help and counseling. You deserve to be happy. So if you feel depressed, make an appointment today.

Many places are set up to treat depression and substance abuse because they occur together so commonly. You may receive treatment for both depression and substance abuse at the same time. Remember that substance abuse will not help you with your mental health because substance abuse will exacerbate your symptoms and not treat the root cause. Instead, have the symptoms of depression medically reviewed. Whether you're dealing with substance abuse or another mental health issue, you may consider looking at support groups. Support groups are very common for individuals with substance abuse issues. They are available for nearly every sort of issue, including most mental health conditions and eating disorders. Support groups provide emotional support and coping resources for people going through similar experiences. There are some support groups for a family member too. What is the primary cause of depression? Like with many mental health issues, there isn't a single, primary cause to depression. Many medical associations, peer-reviewed studies, and treatment facilities have studied this dilemma and found several potential causes. Several risk factors can play into depression, and some may overlap in your specific case. Genetics likely play some role, but other factors may influence depression, such as chronic stress or alcohol or drugs. In some cases, physical diseases and ailments, such as cardiovascular disease, can contribute to depression or similar conditions. Can depression make you make bad decisions? Yes. Depression can change your ability to think in several ways, including reducing your decision-making capability. What will happen if you cry a lot? Crying in and of itself isn't a bad thing. Often, it's a good way for the body to process emotions. But if you're crying a lot, aren't sure why, and are showing some of the symptoms from the above list, it may be time to talk to a mental health practitioner or health care professional. What is the most reliable symptom of depression? Here are some warning signs you have major depressive disorder and may want to speak to a mental health professional for a greater health awareness and to get more health information, according to the Mayo Clinic:  Feeling of sadness or hopelessness Angry outbursts and irritability over small matters Loss of interest in normal activities and particularly loss of interest over activities that were greatly enjoyed Sleep problems, including insomnia or too many hours of sleep Tiredness or lack of energy Change in appetite: either reduced appetite and weight loss or increased appetite and weight gain Frequent thoughts of death or suicide Unexplained physical symptoms (such as headaches, back pain, or stomachaches) Substance abuse  Does depression make you less intelligent? It can certainly make you feel that way. According to Harvard Health Publishing, that's because depression affects your attention and memory, information-processing skills, and lowers your cognitive flexibility (adapting to changing situations) and executing functioning (ability to get something done). Depression is one of the most common causes of brain fog. If you are concerned you are dealing with this, talk to a mental health professional or health care professional for more health information. How long does it take to feel normal after stopping antidepressants? It depends â€“ in part on the strength of the antidepressant you're taking, how long you've been on it, and other factors. People with depression should not come off an antidepressant without making sure to first talk to their doctor to get health information. You have to taper off antidepressants or you risk going into withdrawal. You may have withdrawal symptoms up to six weeks after stopping your antidepressants. Some people may experience them for months. Remember to talk to a mental health professional or doctor and get all the health information you need before stopping an antidepressant.",2022-09-07,Diagnosis
Does Social Media Cause Depression?,BetterHelp,"Understanding The Relationship Between Mental Health And Technology The advancements of the last decade have fundamentally changed the ways we socialize and have done so faster and more dramatically than ever before seen in human history. Social media continually updates us on each other's feelings and experiences. This hyperconnectivity we are experiencing, while enjoyable in many ways, may come with a darker side. Our social media habits have more influence over our mental health than we like to believe. When one logs on to a social platform, within a handful of seconds, they are bombarded by the meals, relationships, and mood statuses of dozens of acquaintances.  You Can Heal From Social Media-Related DepressionGet Stronger In Online Therapy - Click Here While it is a real joy to share a recipe with your grandma or watch a video with a friend states away, social media has also amplified our negative social interactions. Cyberbullying, doxxing, intense tribalism, and feelings of inadequacy are at an all-time high. Sites like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, have also shown to distort our perception of events â€“ people often only post the most sensational news or an idealized version of themselves or their ideas. How these (often subtle) distortions affect us when they are occurring on such a large scale is not yet fully understood. In the last decade, mental health issues like depression and anxiety have been on the rise. Many experts think that the rise in social media may be a significant cause of the increasing frequency of these issues. In this article, we are going to take a quick look at the science that may point to links between social media and the rising rates of depression. Is Social Media Causing Depression And Anxiety? Depressive symptoms are widespread in the United States, and rates of those Depressive symptoms are widespread in the United States, and rates of those found with them are increasing. By 2030, it is estimated that depression will be the leading cause of disability amongst countries with a high-income populace. While the theories surrounding the cause of growth in the rates of depressive symptoms are varied, many experts believe it has much to do with the shifting social and technological landscape of our lives. According to the Pew Research Center, amongst Americans, 92% go online daily, and 32% go online near constantly. In the last couple of years, multiple studies have begun with the intention to figure out just how social media is affecting our mental health. It had already been found that there is a correlation between internet usage and suicide rates for both men and women, so many focused primarily on social media. One such study was conducted by researchers from The Pittsburgh School of Medicine. This study found that the ones who used social media the most were more than two-and-a-half times more likely to be depressed than those who used social media the least. In another study done by experts in Canada and Australia, a direct correlation was found between television, social media, and depression. Other studies have shown the same relationship with anxiety. If you or someone you know is experiencing suicidal thoughts, help is available. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline can be reached at 1-800-273-8255 and is available 24/7, or you can text the word ""HOME"" to 741741 to reach the Crisis Text Line. While the science may seem straightforward, most of these studies made a point to stress that we still are unsure what these correlations mean. While depressive symptoms and social media are linked, it is unclear if social media is the cause or if depressed people are more likely to be alone and to be seeking connections online. Trying to put the chicken before the egg in these circumstances is essential if we are to understand the root cause of this ever-growing mental health issue. Social Media And Young Adults  Young adults are in the midst of developing an identity for themselves and are uniquely susceptible to the influence of the many social media applications. It is easy to see that apps like Snapchat and TikTok are driving a large portion of youth culture online.  Teens and young adults are most likely to be found on social media. Roughly 90% of young adults use social media at least once a day, and it accounts for about 20% of their total phone and computer usage. There are two major reasons why young people flock to social media. One is that it gives them the ability to feel connected to their friends (and family members, though perhaps they don't always welcome this). They feel a sense of emotional support, being able to talk to their peers whenever and wherever they are. The other is that social media encourages teens and adolescents to stay connected by providing them with a sense of validation. The ""likes,"" ""shares,"" and ""retweets"" provide positive feedback for them - when they say something witty or post a particularly well-done selfie, for example. However, in recent years, these positive aspects have become overshadowed by the disturbing increase in rates of mental illness among young people. A good example of this can be found in the rates of adolescent depression. In the 12 years since social media hit the scene, we have seen adolescent depression rates rise. From 2005 to 2015, the rates of depression amongst teens rose from roughly 9% to 13%. The Child Mind Institute noted that from the introduction of smartphones in 2007, to the year 2015, visits to counseling centers on college campuses for anxiety and depression jumped 30 percent. In 2019, more teens than ever were reporting depressive symptoms. One in five girls (the most at risk for this mental health issue) is expected to report some incident of depression. It is thought that those who feel like they are lonely will utilize social media since the immediate and dynamic nature of the apps provides positive feedback in the form of quick social rewards. In lieu of going out and interacting in real life, social media encourages teens who feel lonely to spend time sending out messages or clicking ""like"", as a form of faux social interaction. Depression is a complex issue, and it is unlikely there is a straightforward answer to why we see it continue to rise. At the same time, a growing number of experts are pointing out that outsourcing a considerable percentage of our social lives to the digital realm must be having a profound impact on us in several ways we still do not fully understand. How Social Media Likely Causes Depression For many mental health professionals, the evidence is strong enough to issue warnings about social media usage, and to recommend digital detoxes for those hooked by it. Other experts have already started to investigate the likely reasons social media causes depressive symptoms, as well as what constitutes healthy social media use. Some of the most prominent suspects in the link between social media and depressive symptoms are upward social comparison, cyberbullying, and the 'fear of missing out.' Upward Social Comparison The upward social comparison refers to the comparison of oneself to those one perceives as better or more successful. Social media popularized images of success and wealth and can make people feel like they are inadequate. While upward social comparison can be motivating in small doses, the prevalence of social media tends to make us believe that a disproportionate amount of people are doing above average. This issue is compounded by the fact that most people tend only to post positive things. People post photos with the mess cropped out; they are always smiling or in good lighting. Over time, we begin to assume this idealized image put forward is their reality, and in turn, we wrongfully believe we are less happy or prosperous than we should be. A comparison is often made here with the negative effects advertisements are thought to have on people's self-image. Just as advertisements putting beautiful and skinny people in front of us all the time are found to hurt self-esteem, we can expect social media to be doing the same. Fear-Of-Missing-Out The Fear-Of-Missing-Out (FOMO) is the ""pervasive apprehension that others might be having rewarding experiences from which one is absent."" FOMO is related a bit to upward social comparison in this context, but more about social isolation human beings feel when others are doing activities together without them. Social media emphasizes the most exciting things happening at any given time, or, you could say, social media tells you about everything you are missing out on. A study titled ""Social Media Use and Perceived Social Isolation Among Young Adults in the US"" examined the connection between social media use and feelings of isolation. Using a sample size of 1,787 social media users between ages 19 and 32, It found that more time spent on social media sites led to higher risk of a person feeling socially isolated. Conversely, a study from the University of Pennsylvania (suitably titled ""No More FOMO"") found a direct link between limiting social media use and reduced feelings of depression and loneliness. The Pennsylvania study examined two groups of undergraduates: the first group was limited to just 30 minutes a day of social media use; the other group had no restrictions whatsoever. After three weeks, the study found the first group experienced significantly lower feelings of isolation and ""FOMO"" than the control group. When you are constantly being told what you are not participating in, no matter how extroverted you are, you will feel like people are having fun without you. You Can Heal From Social Media-Related DepressionGet Stronger In Online Therapy - Click Here Cyberbullying Cyberbullying is another likely cause of depression amongst young adults. Cyberbullying is a progression of typical bullying antics brought to the digital realm. The Internet's permeation throughout our lives, including our homes, makes this form of bullying feel much more inescapable and smothering. This form of bullying pervades nearly all forms of youth entertainment. While teens and young adults are more prone to being 'bullied,' cyberstalking and online harassment are just as prevalent.  In one survey, 56 percent of people who responded had felt harassed at some time while using Facebook. An Additional Concern: Social Media, Sleep Deprivation, and Substance Abuse An additional, under-remarked effect social media has on people - especially young people - is sleep deprivation. In their effort to stay connected on the different platforms, such people can forgo healthy sleep. The Child Mind Institute has noted the strong relationship between screentime and sleep issues. This, in turn, can leave them at increased risk for not only depression, but also substance abuse. In contrast to the common argument that substance abuse causes sleep issues, multiple studies have found, in fact, the reverse: sleep issues lead to increased risk of substance abuse. And given the well-established connection between depression and substance abuse, there is a very real possibility that spending time on the different platforms of social media may lead to increased risk of substance abuse among young people. Should We Stop Using Social Media? This is ultimately up to you. Some things are better for some people than others. You may benefit from the social interactions social media allows, or it may be affecting you in a negative way. At the very least, minors should be monitored in their use of social media by family members such as parents. If you are feeling depressed, you need to be honest with yourself about the potential causes. Perhaps consider limiting your Facebook use, as well as that of other platforms. You might also consider talking to family Social media as a concept is not a harmful thing, but we should ensure that we create and use it in ways that are congruent with good mental health. Are You Feeling Depressed? Depression is incredibly common, and its causes are myriad. The good news is that you do not have to deal with it alone. While social media may have its issues, the Internet does allow us easy and quick access to counselors and professional advice. If you feel you are experiencing depression or any form of mental illness, don't hesitate to seek help. Some people prefer speaking about potentially vulnerable topics like depression face-to-face. If this is the case for you, make sure that licensed therapists nearby have experience treating people with depression. However, not everyone has access to reputable, licensed therapists. This is where online counseling platforms like BetterHelp offer solutions. You may access online therapy from the comfort and privacy of your own home.   ",2022-08-26,Education
"Depression In Teens: Recognize Symptoms, Seek Treatment, And Prevent Teen Depression",BetterHelp,"Teen angst and hormonal changes are often associated with the shifts in mood that teenagers may be going through during adolescence. For example, many believe that behaviors like lashing out, becoming more withdrawn (or looking to be more independent), or not enjoying the things that they used to are all part of being a teen. While this may be true for some teenagers, others may be having trouble coping with the stresses in their daily lives. Sometimes, these changes in mood can actually be indicative of a mental health disorder like depression. For concerned parents, the question may often be, how can I spot depression in teens and get them the help they need? Fortunately, depression (once identified) is treatable and manageable with the right support. If you have a child that may have the disorder, here is a guide on how you can recognize signs of depression in teens, seek out treatment, and prevent teen depression. Depression in Teens: What Does It Look Like? Be The Rock For A Teen In Your Life Living With Depression Find A Therapist Who Can Show You How Teens are faced with a unique set of challenges as they grow and develop. These situations, like forming friendships, navigating puberty, and figuring out who they want to become, are just a few of the stressors that they may have in their lives. For some, navigating these challenges can be easy. For others, they may feel immense pressure from these changes. As a result, teens may go through a whirlwind of different emotions during this new stage of their lives. With that in mind, there is a major difference between temporary moods and depression. Feelings like sadness and anger come and go. Depression, however, can have a major impact on your teen's mood for a significant amount of time (depending on the type of experience they may have). The first step in noticing these symptoms begins with exactly what to look for. Symptoms of Teen Depression               Depression in teens is much like depression in older populations, with the exception of some symptoms that will impact the lives of teens differently. Common depression symptoms to look for include:  Feeling sad, hopeless, or helpless (or feelings of numbness and emptiness) Increased irritability and anger, which may result in more lashing out Increased anxiety Withdrawn behavior and isolating oneself away from friends and family A lack of pleasure in activities previously enjoyed Low energy and no motivation to follow through on daily tasks and actions Slower speech and movements (or issues feeling restless or staying still) Changes in sleep patterns, either sleeping too much or too little Changes in eating patterns, either eating more or eating less than usual Problems with concentration and focus Random aches and pains throughout the body that do not have a logical explanation and may not be treated by traditional treatment methods Problems with performance or behavior in school (dropping grades, getting into fights or trouble, etc.) An obsession with death or suicide and self-harm behaviors like cutting or burning (if you believe that your teen may be at risk of harming themselves, please seek out help immediately. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255, and it is available 24 hours every day.)  As you can see from the above, it can be easy to see why some parents may see symptoms of depression and associate them with growing up. For example, it can be perfectly natural for teenagers to need more food and sleep as they grow and develop. They may also start moving away from certain activities that they feel are childish or begin asking for more freedom. What is important to remember is that, when the symptoms above are experienced together, this is when a mental illness may be at play. For example, if your teen is showing emotional changes in addition to some of these physical changes, it could be depression. However, it is also important to note that not everyone will experience all the symptoms of depression. Some teens may only exhibit a few choice symptoms. You should also be on the lookout for co-existing disorders or issues. These may include anxiety, eating disorders, self-harm, or body dysmorphia, just to name a few. Overall, it can be concerning as a parent to see these kinds of changes in your teen. However, once you know how to see the warning signs, you are in a better position to help them get the help they need. If you see any of these depression symptoms, let's take a look at what you should do next. What You Can Do to Get Help  Staying vigilant is the first step. The next step? Once you've identified depression symptoms in your teen, you will want to reach out for help so that you can receive treatment and support for your child. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) encourages teens and parents to schedule an appointment with their primary care physician first. Although the symptoms of depression do not always need an underlying cause, some depressive episodes may be triggered by a health condition that a doctor will be able to find and identify. If depression symptoms are present and there are no contributing medical problems, the next step will be meeting with a therapist. Depression symptoms may be able to be recognized on their own. However, it's always important to receive an official diagnosis from a medical health professional before any action is taken. Your doctor may be able to give you a recommendation for a nearby counselor or you may find one in your area. If you are unable to find the right resources for your teen near you, you may want to consider online counseling platforms. BetterHelp is an online counseling platform dedicated to helping those in need to connect with certified counselors. Being able to speak with a counselor from your own home, on a schedule that works best for you and your child, can be a major benefit. Additionally, if you find that one counselor may not be the best fit for the two of you, you won't have to travel in order to find another one. If your teen does not respond to therapy on its own, medication may also be recommended as a form of treatment to help stabilize their mood and overcome depression symptoms. Once you have the right treatment plan and your teen begins experiencing relief from their symptoms, the next step is prevention! Moving Forward: Tips for Preventing Teen Depression Be The Rock For A Teen In Your Life Living With Depression Find A Therapist Who Can Show You How A lot of what your teen may learn in therapy is how to cope with their depression and stressors that can lead to depression. One way to help your teen is to learn these coping mechanisms as well so that they can implement these tips better. Here are some of the tips you can use to help your teen cope with and prevent your depression.  Making sure that your teen is getting enough sleep on a regular basis Reducing stress where possible, whether that means figuring out how to better manage their current workload or eliminate tasks that are causing stress Providing your teen with healthier meal options Making sure your teen is taking part in more activities that make them happy Helping your teen get regular exercise, whether you decide to do something as basic as taking a walk every morning or going to the gym (you can also encourage your teen to sign up for a sport that they enjoy) Having your teen spend more time with friends and family Being supportive and allowing them to vent about their problems if something is bothering them Challenging any unrealistic or distorted thoughts or beliefs  While these are some of the things you can do to help your teen, it is important to know that they will have to do some of the work themselves. Working through their feelings and challenging negative thoughts is a process that takes place internally. However, the habits that they cultivate during their teenage years are something that you can absolutely help out with. Self-Help And Self-Care Self-help and self-care will make it easier for your teen to navigate their depression symptoms. Additionally, it will help them to build habits that will allow them to reduce the impact of depression in the future. Once they know how to better care for themselves when teen depression strikes, they will be able to handle depression symptoms if they appear down the road as well. Conclusion There is a major difference between teen behavior associated with puberty and behavior associated with depression. Whether you have an adolescent that has been exhibiting concerning behaviors or you want to plan for the future, using the guide above will help you understand what teen depression looks like, what you can do to help your teen, and how you can prevent depression relapses in the future. When in doubt, it is recommended to speak with a licensed mental health care professional.",2022-08-24,Special Groups
Am I Feeling Sad Or Something More Serious? How To Know If You Have Depression,BetterHelp,"All of us have our bad days. Whether we are dealing with difficult circumstances or trying hardships, we may all have periods where we are feeling less happy than usual. It's perfectly natural. But what happens when that day turns into days or seems to stretch across weeks? When does a typical case of the blues point to something more serious? While everyone may experience negative emotions, knowing when these emotions develop into a mental illness like depression is key to avoiding further progression. Although depression can be daunting, there are plenty of resources out there that can help you treat and cope with your depression. Awareness around this mental health disorder is the first step towards seeking out treatment. If you have been feeling sadder than usual and you believe it may be more than a bad mood, here's how to know if you have depression. What Is Depression? Wondering About The Difference Between Sadness And Depression? Online Therapy Can Teach You The Difference Depression is a mental health disorder that is characterized by markedly low moods that impact an individual's ability to function as they normally do. Those with depression will also often struggle with a lack of energy, both physically and mentally, and will lose interest in activities that they previously enjoyed. For those who are experiencing sadness, it can be easy to confuse the two while you are in the process of dealing with your emotions. However, depression comes with a far more distinctive set of symptoms than what you may experience when you are feeling sad. What are they? Let's take a look. Symptoms of Depression The symptoms of depression are often far more noticeable and impactful than the emotions we feel when we are sad. The major signs of depression to look out for include:  Changes in mood such as feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, and sadness. Other emotions and feelings like guilt, anger, and worthlessness may be present. In some cases, individuals express feeling numb or empty as a result of their depression. Increased isolation and withdrawing from activities that the individual previously enjoyed. Weight gain or weight loss due to increased or decreased appetite. Changes in sleep, which can include sleeping less or sleeping more as well as experiencing nightmares. Difficulty focusing or concentrating on various tasks. Anxiety and restlessness. Slower speech and movements. Engaging in high-risk activities like drinking, doing drugs, or behaving recklessly. Experiencing physical aches and pains that have no explainable cause and cannot be treated using medication or other methods. Having suicidal thoughts or actively considering suicide. If you believe that you are at risk of hurting yourself or are having suicidal thoughts, seek help immediately. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255 and it is available 24 hours every day.  As you can see from the above, many of the symptoms of depression do not fit into the definition of sadness or the state of being sad. Rather, sadness is just one part of depression that, when combined with other symptoms, results in a bigger problem. However, sadness and depression may not always be easy to differentiate. Different people can experience different symptoms. Along with personal experience, there are different types of depression that you may experience as well. Let's walk through the different types of depression that may be impacting you. Types of Depression The symptoms of depression provided above are often associated with major depression. However, major depression is not the only form of depression out there. In order to successfully distinguish sadness from depression, we need to know the multiple faces of this mental illness. Besides major depressive disorder, which is accompanied by more severe symptoms, other forms of depression include:  Seasonal Affective Disorder: Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a form of depression that can affect you during winter months when the weather becomes gloomy and the sun disappears. This form of depression may not be as severe as major depression and often lifts once spring comes. However, it will still differ from sadness as those affected will experience some of the symptoms listed above.      Persistent Depressive Disorder: Unlike major depression, which can last for months, those going through persistent depressive disorder can experience low-grade symptoms of depression for two years or longer. Although symptoms may not be as severe, the length of the depressive episode can still take a toll on the individual over time. As it is with other forms of depression, you may be able to recognize your mental illness if you see some of the common symptoms of depression. Bipolar Disorder: While bipolar disorder is not a depressive disorder, those who have it do experience depressive episodes. The major difference, however, is that you will also experience manic episodes. These episodes will produce the opposite effects, with euphoric moods and risk-taking being some of the biggest symptoms. If you believe that you may be experiencing bipolar disorder, it is important that you seek out help as some forms of this disorder can be very serious.  Different People Experience It Differently While these are only a couple of examples, you may have already noticed a difference between what you are feeling and what is listed above. However, there is one more factor that we need to discuss before we wrap up this section. Beyond the type of depression you are dealing with, you should also know that different people can experience depression differently. For men who have depression, aggressive behaviors and high-risk actions may be more prominent symptoms. As a result, men may not be able to tell that they have depression because anger seems to be the main symptom. For women, however, depression may take more of a somber approach. They may experience more of the sadness and fatigue that depression can cause. However, these are just some examples of issues you may face in your own depressive episode. There is no specific set of symptoms that everyone experiences. Knowing what depression is and what it may look like is the first step towards seeking out help. But knowing the difference between sadness and depression can better help you understand what the next step is. So, how can you tell the difference between sadness and depression? Learning how to know if you have depression rather than sadness can be quite simple. Sadness or Depression? How to Know If You Have Depression Sadness is a common human emotion that we all experience. When something happens in our lives that upsets us, it is only natural to experience sadness as a result. However, sadness will often feel much lighter than depression does. Additionally, sadness does not come with as many of the physical symptoms as depression does. Once you work through your feelings, you are able to move forward from your sadness. Depression, on the other hand, impacts you in such a way that is abnormal. You do not experience sadness on its own but additional symptoms of depression such as fatigue, feelings of helplessness and hopelessness, and a major shift in behavior. While your sadness may have one focus and trigger, depression tends to cause you to see everything in a negative light. Put simply, sadness is an emotion that we feel when we deal with something that causes us distress. Depression is a mental illness that has a major impact on our lives. One great way to understand the difference is to think about the way you are coping with a certain situation. For example, let's imagine that you have recently lost your job. This is absolutely a situation that could trigger sadness. However, while you are sad about this loss, you still find joy in other things. You are able to work through your emotions and not let the situation at hand interrupt your life in a big way. Sadness, like any other emotion, is something that we feel and process. Now, let's imagine that you have recently lost your job and are feeling sad about it. However, this sadness seems to stretch out for a considerable amount of time. You may feel like you will never be able to land another job. You may be sleeping more, eating more, and not caring about personal tasks and chores. If your sadness is impacting your life beyond just the loss that you have experienced, you are most likely dealing with depression. What is important to remember if you believe that you have depression is that, like sadness, there are ways to alleviate it. What Do I Do Next? Whether you are dealing with sadness or depression, the next best step to take is to reach out for help. Being able to talk to someone about the trouble you are going through will allow you to receive the support that you need. It will also equip you with the coping mechanisms necessary to work through these difficult emotions. One option that you have is to seek out counseling resources in your area. However, not everyone has access to licensed counselors nearby. This is when you may want to consider online counseling resources. Wondering About The Difference Between Sadness And Depression? Online Therapy Can Teach You The Difference For example, BetterHelp is an online counseling platform dedicated to helping individuals connect with the help that they need. You may access BetterHelp from the comfort and privacy of your own home, on your schedule. Feeling sad for an extended period of time can be concerning, but it doesn't mean that you have depression. To understand the difference between the two (and to seek out help for either), use the information provided above as a basic depression test to find out what you may be dealing with. Once you find out how to know if you have depression, you can take action. If you find that you relate to the symptoms of depression, take the first step by reaching out to a counselor.

Postpartum Depression Treatments: Natural Methods For Healing After Birth,BetterHelp,"Postpartum depression is a mental health condition that's marked by a complex combination of physical, emotional, behavioral, and mental changes that can arise shortly after giving birth. While not entirely uncommon in the history of depression disorders, postpartum depression can feel extraordinarily isolating and can be a negative and uncomfortable experience for both mother and child. Luckily, there are many natural approaches for postpartum depression that can reduce the symptoms and also strengthen the mother's mind and body when used in combination with professional treatments. At Risk Of Postpartum Depression? Therapy Can HelpClick Here To Match With A Licensed Therapist What Is Postpartum Depression, And Why Does It Happen? ""Postpartum"" refers to the period after a woman gives birth when her mind and body are recovering and readjusting after pregnancy. Thus, postpartum depression is a depression disorder that occurs specifically after pregnancy. During a time frame of approximately 3-5 days after pregnancy, it's normal for people to experience minor depressive symptoms, known as the ""baby blues,"" but if the symptoms are severe and last for longer than 2 weeks, the depression is termed officially as postpartum depression disorder. It is also important to point out that it is entirely possible for any new parent, including fathers, partners, and adoptive parents to develop postpartum depression. The symptoms of postpartum depression, sometimes called perinatal depression, involve a generalized sense of apathy, a lack of feeling connected to the newborn baby, thoughts of self-harm or harm to the baby, feeling like a bad mother, and other symptoms characteristic of any depression disorder. Postpartum depression can be a dangerous and uncomfortable condition that must be treated immediately for the health and wellbeing of both the mother and the baby. Postpartum depression can occur for a variety of reasons, and some parents may even be predisposed to the symptoms due to genetics. One of the primary reasons, though, why women experience postpartum depression has to do with hormones. During pregnancy, progesterone and estrogen levels are extremely high, while after birth, these hormones drop steeply and dramatically. In some women, this drop is more pronounced and can set off postpartum depression symptoms; in other women, the drop in hormones doesn't affect them in the same way, and they simply don't develop postpartum depression disorder. A drop in thyroid hormones after birth may also be a core cause of postpartum depression since low levels of these hormones are known to cause depression symptoms under other conditions as well. Natural Postpartum Depression Treatments While most cases of postpartum depression require medical treatment, there are a variety of highly successful, all-natural treatments that can be used to improve the symptoms of postpartum depression. While using even just one of these treatments can elicit powerful change, using a few of these together as part of a postpartum depression treatment protocol could be even better. In fact, in the history of depression through time, most health practitioners have used various natural treatments to treat postpartum depression Postpartum depression is a serious disorder that requires careful consideration from a professional experienced with the symptoms of the disorder. With the help of your doctor, therapist, or other licensed professional, you can put together a natural plan for overcoming the symptoms of postpartum depression. Always consult a healthcare professional about your postpartum depression symptoms before starting any of these treatments. Acupuncture For Postpartum Depression The ancient Chinese healing method of acupuncture has been used for thousands of years in eastern medicine as a treatment for all kinds of ailments, including postpartum depression. Acupuncture is very different from western medicine regarding the way that its practitioners view illness, but its effectiveness is surprisingly high when it comes to treating postpartum depression. This treatment operates on the idea that all of the body's illnesses are related to some sort of energetic imbalance that can be corrected with the use of needles or stimulation on certain specific points. Depression disorders, including postpartum depression, sometimes occur due to imbalances in the body of various kinds. Acupuncture also utilizes knowledge of the 4 humors and carefully considers the flow of energy through all the systems of the body. Thus, acupuncture acknowledges the effects of not only physiological influences on postpartum depression symptoms but also emotional and even spiritual influences. When combined with therapy/counseling and a healthy diet, one 2014 study demonstrated that acupuncture is just as successful (if not more successful) than the popular antidepressant medications in treating postpartum depression. As a bonus, acupuncture carries none of the side effects of medication, and can even offer extra benefits such as boosting energy and mental clarity. Light Therapy For Postpartum Depression Light therapy is an up and coming treatment with a surprisingly high success rate in treating not only postpartum depression, but other types of depression as well. Light therapy comes in many different forms, but the basic concept is that different light wave frequencies can reset and heal various conditions, including the symptoms of postpartum depression. Bright light therapy has been used to successfully treat SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder) for many years, but researchers are just now starting to investigate the effects of light on other forms of depression, such as postpartum depression. With light therapy, postpartum depression, patients must use the light (often a 10,000-lux lightbox) for a continuous period every day over the course of a few weeks to achieve notable, sustained effects. Because light therapy takes some time to show honestly dramatic effects in reducing the symptoms of postpartum depression, it's best used as part of a protocol. However, although it takes time for more noticeable effects to occur, many new parents with postpartum depression report feeling more awake, balanced, and clear-headed even after only a few sessions with the lightbox. Healthy Lifestyle Choices For Postpartum Depression Although it can be difficult for people with postpartum depression to maintain healthy lifestyle practices, this is an important part of recovery. Eating a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and adopting an easy to follow schedule are some of the key components of a healthy lifestyle, and these healthy lifestyle patterns can help folks with postpartum depression to feel more balanced and healthier while they work with other postpartum depression treatment options. Many parents experiencing postpartum depression find that they benefit greatly from developing and sticking to a daily routine. Of course, things can get off-schedule as a new parent, but having an approximate time to wake up, go to bed, eat lunch and dinner, and do other necessary daily tasks is key to feeling more ""normal"" and balanced after giving birth.  Various types of depression disorders, including postpartum depression, can be managed more effectively when the patient is able to stick to a schedule. To help with postpartum depression recovery, it's essential that surrounding family members do their part to support the mother and baby when it comes to developing and adjusting to the new schedule. People with postpartum depression may need more support than other new mothers in the time following the birth of their baby; sensitivity and an understanding of the symptoms and treatments for postpartum depression are important for family members to have. Individuals with postpartum depression who have the support of their family members are more likely to recover quickly and adjust more effectively. Meditation Or Hypnosis For Postpartum Depression Some people with postpartum depression face underlying psychological issues that could potentially be treated with the use of guided meditation and/or hypnosis techniques. Hypnosis is an alternative treatment that has become more popular in recent years as a treatment for not only postpartum depression, but also other mood disorders, addictions, relationship healing, and more. Postpartum depression has a variety of causes, and while most women with postpartum depression have physiological issues that may explain their symptoms, other women have subconscious thoughts or emotions that are affecting them too. This is where hypnosis could potentially uncover underlying trauma, worry, or emotions that are causing the postpartum depression symptoms, and then help the patient to heal naturally in their own time. Many women with postpartum depression have not only the physiological symptoms of hormonal shifts after pregnancy but also emotional or psychological struggles as well. Many of these emotional/psychological influences lie under the surface of the conscious mind. As such, hypnosis has proven to be successful in helping women overcome these influences and being able to recover from postpartum depression. Therapy/Counseling For Postpartum Depression Therapy and counseling can be one of the most important resources for any woman with postpartum depression. Being able to talk openly about emotions, thoughts, and experiences with an experienced professional who can offer advice and support is essential. While talking to family members is good, many women feel pressure from society to feel the ""right way"" after giving birth, and women with postpartum depression may need the additional support of a therapist who has knowledge and expertise in regard to the symptoms of postpartum depression. In the history of depression, therapy has almost always been one of the key resources that patients with depression have had, especially for women with postpartum depression. Still, even today, therapy continues to be vital for recovery! There are many therapists who specialize in working with patients with depression, and still more therapists who have expert knowledge about specifically postpartum depression.

Melatonin And Depression: How A Lack Of Sleep Can Cause Depressive Symptoms,BetterHelp,"Anyone who has experienced a sleepless night can affirm the uncomfortable aftereffects of unsatisfying sleep: irritation, fatigue, stress, and an inability to concentrate. While one night of sleeplessness may produce short-term effects that are resolved after sleep cycles are returned to the eight-hour norm, continued instances of sleep trouble may lead to more serious issues. The inability to fall or stay asleep is known as insomnia, and those who struggle with chronic, long-term insomnia are in danger of developing other issues such as anxiety, stress disorders, and depressive disorders. In turn, these mood disorders can also give rise to sleep disorders, which makes the link between the melatonin and depression difficult to discern. Good Sleep And Wellness Are Right Around The CornerOnline Therapy Can Give You The Help You Need There are many links between a lack of melatonin and depression. Some scientists argue that insomnia causes depression, and some argue that depression causes insomnia. The two theories often intersect, as it is proven that many symptoms of depression and insomnia go hand in hand. A lack of melatonin, which leads to insomnia, may cause symptoms of depression, such as low moods, anxiety, unstable emotions, and an inability to perform up to standard, which can then cause an individual to develop depression due to those moods. Likewise, an individual with depression often experiences insomnia at the same time (almost 75% of those with depressive disorders also have self-reported symptoms of insomnia). These symptoms can exacerbate existing depression or cause a relapse. The Link Between Melatonin and Depression Much of an individual's sleep cycle is regulated by the hormone melatonin, found in the pineal gland of the brain. During normal waking hours, melatonin levels are low. However, as it gets dark, optic nerves in the eyes send information to the pineal gland to begin producing melatonin and to promote sleepiness. Those who do not produce sufficient melatonin struggle to sleep at night and some may develop insomnia. Sleep should occupy about a third of our day, or about seven hours per night according to the Center for Disease Control. Sleeping less than seven hours on a continual basis may lead to complications with mental and physical health, such as depression, anxiety, and obesity. According to the Sleep Foundation, those who struggle with insomnia are 10 times as likely to have clinical depression, as well as 17 times more likely to have clinical anxiety. As experience with insomnia increases in quantity and severity, the chances increase. Those with acute and chronic insomnia are much more likely to develop depressive symptoms than those who do not experience sleep deprivation.  Acute vs. Chronic Insomnia Acute insomnia is defined as short-term insomnia. It may be brought about by stressful situations at work or school, family influences, or traumatic events in an individual's life. Acute insomnia only lasts for a couple of days or weeks. If acute insomnia extends beyond a month, it is labeled as chronic insomnia. Chronic insomnia can be triggered by a multitude of events, which are not well-researched. Long-term stressful situations, such as an extremely traumatic experience, difficult home life, or an extremely stressful work environment may cause chronic insomnia. Many researchers cannot predict if or when an individual will develop chronic insomnia, and it is more difficult to resolve than acute insomnia. However, both types are quite likely to cause mental complications that can further irritate and exacerbate insomnia, creating a vicious cycle that is difficult to break. Acute Insomnia and Depression One trigger of acute insomnia may be a stressful work environment. Those struggling with long working hours, such as medical residents (as studied in one research group) may experience acute insomnia at the same time that they experience these work environments. In this study, residents were questioned whether they were experiencing any symptoms of insomnia. 85.9% of residents affirmed that they were experiencing acute insomnia caused by long working hours and stressful job situations. Many of those who were experiencing acute insomnia were also experiencing mild or moderate depressive symptoms. As studied, 67% of those who slept less than six hours the previous night were experiencing depressive symptoms. Out of those who were experiencing depressive symptoms, 45% labeled their symptoms as ""mild"", and 21% labeled their symptoms as ""moderate to severe"". In sharp contrast, 60% of residents who slept over six hours the previous night reported no depressive symptoms whatsoever. This study suggests that even slight events of sleep deprivation can have lasting consequences. The study was specifically geared towards studying acute insomnia, so every intern in the study had only been dealing with sleep deprivation for one month or less. Specifically, many of these interns had varying work schedules, so an individual may have been able to sleep over six hours one night and under six hours another night. Since those who were sleep-deprived (had slept less than six hours the previous night) had likely not been deprived of sleep for a long period of time, this study came to the serious conclusion that even very short-term experiences with sleep deprivation can have lasting consequences. Thankfully, there are melatonin treatments that can help with symptoms of acute insomnia. There are many over-the-counter melatonin supplements that someone with low melatonin levels can take. The effect of melatonin can help the person struggling to sleep greatly. Going about a melatonin treatment should be supervised by a doctor to ensure it will be helpful and safe for you. Good Sleep And Wellness Are Right Around The CornerOnline Therapy Can Give You The Help You Need Chronic Insomnia and Depression Chronic sleep deprivation or insomnia, as it is experienced over a longer period of time, also was found to have impacts on an individual's experience with depression or depressive symptoms. In a study done on another group of medical residents, chronic sleep deprivation was studied in order to determine the link between long-term sleep deprivation and depressive symptoms. At the beginning of the study, only 9% of interns reported chronic insomnia. In the end, after one year of internship, 43% of interns reported chronic insomnia. Likewise, the number of interns reporting depressive symptoms grew as well, from 4.3% to 29.8%. This suggests that over half of interns that experienced new chronic insomnia also experienced new depressive symptoms. This study suggests that similar to episodes of acute insomnia, chronic insomnia, and sleep deprivation also lead to depressive symptoms, either mild or moderate. Those studies also reported a higher burnout rate if they experienced chronic sleep deprivation, which suggests that those who experienced low sleep were more likely to experience stress, anxiety, and a lack of interest in their work. These are all symptoms of depression that can negatively affect an individual's mental state. The Link Between Melatonin and Depression: What Way Does It Go? The symptoms of low melatonin and depression often go hand in hand. Symptoms of low melatonin levels mirror many symptoms of depression, especially the mood changes associated with both disorders. A sleepless night produces mood shifts that can become difficult to change if insomnia lasts beyond a few days. The mood changes caused by different types of insomnia may help to explain exactly why individuals who are struggling with sleep disorders could also develop depressive symptoms like anxiety, frustration, hopelessness, exhaustion, and issues with concentration. These mood changes overall could lead to a lower quality of life for an individual and can cause the decreased school or work performance, an increased risk of self-harm, and at times, suicidal ideation. Physical effects are known to appear from chronic or acute insomnia as well, such as obesity, inflammation, gastrointestinal problems, and other chronic disorders. These physical problems can add to an individual's poor mental state and increase their risk for many mental health disorders. Overall, however, it is clear that higher or more severe occurrences of insomnia can most definitely lead to a lower quality of life, which is one of the main symptoms of depression. Those who feel they have a lower quality of life can easily slip into depressive mindsets and develop depressive habits. Low melatonin levels and sleep disorders have also been proven to lead to relapses in depressive episodes. Those who have had a depressive disorder in the past may be triggered by the mood changes that come along with insomnia and slip back into a depressive episode. In fact, those who have struggled with depression in the past and who develop insomnia are anywhere from two to four times more likely to experience another depressive episode in the future. Psychologists agree that monitoring an individual's sleep can help predict future depressive episodes, as experiencing insomnia for more than two weeks could be an indicator of a future major depressive episode. What's more, studies have found that some individuals with chronic or acute insomnia can develop new minor or major depression, or another depressive disorder that they have not experienced in the past. In one study, 16% of individuals who labeled themselves as depressed had experienced sleep disorders or insomnia at least two weeks or more before their depressive episode began. This suggests what other literature has studied, which is that those with insomnia may have an increased risk of developing depression and anxiety. 68% of those interviewed reported that they had developed symptoms of insomnia at or immediately after they developed depression. While not adhering to the theory that insomnia causes depression, this does reaffirm the fact that many times, depression and insomnia go hand in hand.  Melatonin and Depression Overall, while experts cannot determine if there is a specific link between low melatonin levels and depression, many studies seem to prove that there is definitely overlap between the two disorders. Insomnia may lead to many of the same symptoms that those with depression struggle with, like anxiety, moodiness, increased stress, a feeling that they have a lower quality of life, or an inability to perform as well as they would like in work or in school. These symptoms may force an individual to develop some type of depression. In turn, depression can exacerbate sleep deprivation and increase the factors that lead to an individual's insomnia in the first place. This vicious cycle is a clue that low melatonin levels and depression are inextricably linked in various ways. While the two disorders may seem overwhelming, doctors, scientists, and psychiatrists may recommend a balance of lifestyle changes, medication, and therapy to break this cycle and regain a healthy lifestyle. If you are struggling with a lack of melatonin or depression, you should consider getting professional help. Depression is a very serious mental health concern. A counselor, such as one from BetterHelp can help you cope with your feelings of depression. For a lack of melatonin levels, seeking help from a doctor to discuss melatonin supplements or melatonin treatment is a great idea.

Foods That Help Battle Depression: 7 Foods To Eat And 8 To Avoid,BetterHelp,"Learn How Lifestyle Factors Like Diet Can Improve Your Well-BeingOur BetterHelp Therapists Can Teach You The concept of food as medicine has been around for thousands of years, and for thousands of years, proper nutrition has proven to be one of the most important concepts in the world of medicine. Although it's sometimes surprising in the modern era, following a good diet is often considered essential to inner peace, a fit body, and clear thinking. In fact, there's plenty of evidence that shows that eating a balanced diet can help your body fight symptoms of depression. Nutritionists, doctors, psychologists, and other medical professionals all agree that food plays a massive role in not only our physical well-being but also our mental well-being. So, take a look through some of the depression-battling foods and dietary recommendations to start letting your food help you heal from the inside out. How Can Diet Help Symptoms of Depression? Diet and depression are intrinsically linked. The majority of individuals who experience depression benefit greatly from making dietary changes that improve overall health and target depressive symptoms. The causes of depression vary from person to person, and eating a healthy diet will not magically get rid of your symptoms or cure you of depression. However, a study in BMC Medicine found that those with depression who received nutritional counseling reported significant improvements after 12 weeks. So how exactly does diet help improve symptoms of depression? One of the first things to understand is the gut-brain connection. When your stomach is upset,, and your internal organs are struggling to keep up with an unhealthy diet, your mood can also be negatively affected as a result. When you eat clean, healthy foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other whole, unprocessed foods, on the other hand, you're more likely to end up in a better mood. Plus, when you eat a healthy diet, the inflammation in your intestines goes down, and decreasing inflammation often reduces depression symptoms. Vitamins, minerals, proteins, and omega fatty acids are some of the key players when it comes to treating depression with diet. For a large group of people, depression symptoms can be part of a manifestation of a deficiency that can be treated with supplements and a diet rich in the deficient component. While certain people have other problems on top of deficiencies, many folks with depression experience improved moods when they change their diet to be healthier. Depression-Battling Foods  There are many foods that can target and treat depression symptoms. These are just a few of the best and most well-known foods that are easily accessible, affordable, and tasty that you can incorporate into your diet to help reduce depression. Turkey Turkey contains the precursors necessary for the body to make tryptophan, a key component in creating adequate serotonin (the ""Happy Hormone"") in the body. When your body is having trouble manufacturing or obtaining amino acids from your diet, your mood and overall well-being can suffer greatly. Amino acids are essential for building proteins, which are, in turn, needed to create and manage hormones. If you're feeling blue, chances are good that eating foods like turkeys that are rich in amino acids and their precursors can help you feel better. Chicken is also high in tryptophan. Walnuts, Cashews, And Seeds One of the primary dietary recommendations for people with depression is to eat more omega-3 fatty acids, precisely because of their anti-inflammatory and brain-boosting qualities. All nuts are high in omega fatty acids, but walnuts, cashews, and seeds (like flaxseeds and chia seeds, for example) have higher levels. Add some walnuts or cashews to your salads or throw some seeds onto or into smoothies to get an extra dose of omega-3s throughout the day. Walnuts also make a great on-the-go snack! Unrefined sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds are good choices, too. Dark Leafy Greens Dark leafy greens are fantastic to incorporate into any diet because of their high nutritional content, but vegetables like kale, spinach, and swiss chard are particularly well-suited to help with the symptoms of mood problems like depression and anxiety. Dark leafy greens have high levels of minerals such as folate and iron, both of which have proven effects on reducing depression symptoms. Iron deficiency (otherwise known as anemia) can cause a wide range of health problems, including not only depression, but also fatigue, trouble concentrating, severe headaches, and anxiety. Eating more leafy greens can boost iron intake and minimize the symptoms of anemia, thus also helping reduce some symptoms of depression as well. Avocado  Avocado is another food that's high in omega fatty acids, a food component that's vital for stabilizing and improving mood. Avocados are also high in the amino acid glutathione, a component that inhibits the absorption of negative or toxic fats into the digestive tract. Meanwhile, the fats that are actively present in avocado are quite healthy. Nonetheless, although avocados are very healthy and have a lot of nutrients like vitamin E, beta-carotene, and folate, you want to be careful to not eat too much because of the high-fat content in the fruit. Berries Fresh berries have a vibrant and light flavor that is absolutely delightful in-and-of-itself, but did you know that they also contain depression-lifting components? Strawberries, blackberries, blueberries, and raspberries are all high in vitamin C, a vitamin that's been shown to reduce stress levels and improve overall mood. Because a lot of depression symptoms originate from prolonged periods of stress, giving your body an extra vitamin C boost by eating plenty of berries might just do the trick to lift your spirits. And as a bonus, it'll boost your immunity, too! Green Tea Green tea has been used medicinally for thousands of years in Asia to improve concentration, energy, brain health, and physical well-being. In addition, green tea contains the amino acid theanine, which is responsible for the construction of vital proteins and hormones that manage mood. Without the proper amounts of amino acids in the body, the brain struggles to regulate emotions in a normal way. Thus, it's extremely important to eat foods that contain essential amino acids if you're trying to improve your depressive symptoms through diet. Oranges Oranges are another fruit that's high in vitamin C, so can help minimize stress response while also boosting immunity and general health. Oranges are high in folate (vitamin B9), an essential nutrient for fetal brain development. The connection between folate and the brain continues throughout life, and folate can be crucial in diminishing depression symptoms. A study conducted by Harvard researchers demonstrated that folate breaks down homocysteine, an amino acid that has been linked to higher levels of depression. Thus, oranges are a great food to take along as a snack for whenever you need a snack to improve your mood! Following A Depression-Curing Diet Foods To Avoid Learn How Lifestyle Factors Like Diet Can Improve Your Well-BeingOur BetterHelp Therapists Can Teach You If you're trying to improve your depressive symptoms, not only should you eat more of the foods listed above, but there are also some foods that experts recommend should be avoided. Here are some foods that could potentially increase depression symptoms rather than decrease them:  Refined sugar (consider honey as an alternative) Refined grains and flours Trans fats (also keep an eye out for hydrogenated and brominated oils) MSG (monosodium glutamate) Alcohol High quantities of unhealthy fats (such as margarine or refined oils) Fast foods and packaged products (aim to eat only whole foods whenever possible) Soda pop and other packaged drinks (especially those with artificial flavors or colors)  Planning And Organization Diet is one of the most difficult things to change, but it's also one of the most essential parts of whole-body health. Following a depression-reducing diet can be a significant change for a person with depression symptoms, so here are some tips to help you successfully change your diet without feeling too overwhelmed:  Ask for help preparing food â€“ You don't have to do this alone! If you live with someone who is sensitive to your situation, ask them for help with preparing meals if they're willing. There are also many programs that deliver healthy meals directly to your door according to your specifications and preferences. Do meal prep â€“ When you're up to it, make food for yourself in advance. When you've got a freezer full of delicious, homemade meals that are microwave-and-go, it's much easier to eat healthy, even when you're feeling low. Make a list of ""approved"" foods and meals -You probably have some favorite foods that you like to eat on a regular basis. But, consider what's healthy and nutritious and make a list of things that you can eat while on your depression-treating diet, and look up some ways to make your favorite unhealthy foods in a healthy way. This way, you don't have to think as much when you go to the fridge, searching for a snack, lunch, or a dessert. Have plenty of healthy, depression-fighting snacks â€“ Many people who experience depression find that snacking can be an issue. If you're one of the people who snack when you're feeling down, stock your kitchen pantry with loads of tasty and nutritious snacks that will not only be entertaining, but that will also actively fight your depression symptoms and truly bring up your mood!  Conclusion Eating healthy is a start for treating any disease or disorder. Having a good, nutrient-rich diet makes it possible for your body to do what it needs to do to recover and rebalance; it's difficult to discount the importance of food as a source of medicine. Although dietary improvements have dramatic results for many individuals who experience depression, in many cases therapy or other types of assistance (such as medication) may also be necessary to treat the symptoms for good.

The Male Perspective â€“ Differences Of Depression Symptoms In Men,BetterHelp,"Many people experience depression at some time in their lives. Yet, depression isn't always easy to recognize. That's especially true when a male has depression because their symptoms are often different from those of women. Maybe you're a man who is having some mental or even physical health issues, but you don't know what's wrong. Or maybe your male loved one is looking for answers.  If you have the slightest suspicion that the trouble may be related to depression, it's a good idea to learn more about depression in men and how depression affects men differently than women. Symptoms If you're depressed, you might have any of the symptoms of depression. However, if you're a man, some of the symptoms might be more likely for you. Others show up differently. Here is a look at the signs from a male perspective. Symptoms In Men Men Can Overcome A Variety Of Depression Symptoms BetterHelp Has Expert Therapists To Help The following symptoms often happen during the depression in men. Anger, Aggressive Behavior, And Irritability: Have you ever felt angry, and you didn't know why? Many men feel angry and behave aggressively when they're depressed. Other people typically don't understand the reason behind these thoughts and feelings, and men often don't recognize them as a sign of depression either. Restlessness Or Feeling On Edge: You might feel restless during a depressive episode. You feel like you need to get up and move around, even when you need to stay where you are. Or, you might feel on edge, as if you need to prepare yourself for something terrible that's right around the corner. Losing Interest In Things You Once Enjoyed: Men often lose interest in their work, even if they were once delighted with their job. You might also lose interest in family life or anything else you once found pleasurable. Sexual Problems: If you're having trouble with your sexual performance, the problem could very well be depression if you're a male. You might not even feel the desire to have sex. In either case, it's understandable that you would want to get beyond your depression so you can regain a healthy sex life. Alcohol Or Substance Abuse: One thing that often happens with depression in men is self-medicating with alcohol or illegal drugs. Usually, this begins before the depression takes hold, but it typically continues and increases as the depression deepens. Making High-Risk Choices: Men often take big chances when they're feeling depressed. They may do something physically dangerous, like driving too fast on the freeway. Or, they might gamble with money they need for themselves or to help support their family. Another example of high-risk behavior as a part of depression in men is having sexual affairs or having a lot of unprotected sex. Withdrawing From Others: Depression in men often involves withdrawing from others. Men may isolate themselves from others when they're depressed. Perhaps that's due to a societal trend for parents to teach their boys to solve problems on their own and their girls to be more social creatures. While this trend may be changing, it still affects many men today.  Physical Ailments: Depression in men often takes the form of physical complaints. You may feel your heart racing, have tightness in your chest, experience digestive problems, or notice frequent aches and pains. You might go to your primary physician with these health issues and find that either they can't identify the cause or nothing they do seems to help. Difficulty sleeping: Sleep problems are common in depression in men and women. For men, the trouble is usually that you have trouble going to sleep or staying asleep. Other Symptoms You Might Have In addition to the symptoms that are more prevalent in men, you might also have signs that are common in both men and women. Feeling anxious: Anxiety is associated with depression for many people. It's a feeling of nervousness, unwarranted fear, or worry about the future. Troubles with concentration and memory: Both genders may have a hard time concentrating while they're depressed. They may have memory problems, as well, especially in remembering details. Feeling sad, empty, or hopeless: These feelings are usually a part of a depressive disorder, but not always. For a diagnosis of depression, your mental health expert would look for either these sad feelings or a loss of interest in pleasurable activities. How Are Women's Symptoms Different? Some women's symptoms are similar to those of depression in men. However, women tend to be more likely to have eating disorders along with their depression, for instance. They may also be more likely to oversleep or overeat than men. Gender Differences In Depression Triggers In a 2015 article, Paul R. Albert, Ph.D., reported that, globally, 5.5% of women experienced depression each year, while only 3.2% of men had depression in a year. Albert suggested that the difference could be the different things that trigger depression for men and women. For example, women may be more likely to be sensitive to interpersonal relationship issues, while men seem to be more affected by situations related to their careers and goals. Another factor is the hormonal changes women go through during their lives. For example, if a woman has premenstrual dysphoric disorder or postpartum depression that comes at a time when her hormones are in flux. And, the inconstancy of female hormones may play a role in other forms of depression, too. LiveScience reports that there's evidence that women respond differently to stress. When there's a death in the family, their relationship is rocky, or they lose their job, they think and behave in ways that make the stressful feelings last longer. One way they do this is to ruminate or dwell on upsetting events or situations. They engage in negative self-talk and blame themselves for what happened. Depression in men usually doesn't include a tendency to ruminate, and that may be one reason that sometimes men can get past stressful events more easily. But men do have depression, too. The cause may be partly genetic, as it might be for women. But what brings on a depressive episode? For men, the triggers for depression may include financial problems, life changes, trouble at work or losing a job, or some type of underlying illness. The Severity Of Symptoms In Men And Women The severity of symptoms often differs between men and women. The difference may be partly because men frequently avoid seeking help or don't realize they're suffering from depression. Even if they go to a healthcare professional, that person might not detect the depression behind physical symptoms. So, men's symptoms may become extremely severe before they talk to a mental health professional, while women might more often seek help during the earlier, milder phase. Gender Difference In Suicide Rates Sometimes people with depression think about or attempt suicide. According to data reported by the World Health Organization, the suicide rate for men in the U.S. was 21.1 per 100,000 in 2016, while the rate for U.S. women was only 6.4 per 100,000. Women try to commit suicide more often, but men may be more likely to succeed in the attempt. This difference might go back in part to the fact that men wait so long to get treatment. Differences In Seeking Treatment It's hard to say precisely why women might seek treatment more often than men. It may have to do with cultural differences. Or, it might have more to do with the fact that symptoms in men can be so much harder to recognize. Men may have symptoms that don't show up as the sadness or hopelessness so often associated with depression. Men's symptoms may look more like anger issues, substance abuse problems, or recklessness. That's why it's so vital that you learn to identify any symptoms you're having and realize if they could be indicators of depression. What You Can Do Men Can Overcome A Variety Of Depression Symptoms BetterHelp Has Expert Therapists To Help When a male loved one is showing signs of depression, the most important thing you can do to help is to listen empathetically and offer your support. If he doesn't recognize that these symptoms are related to depression, you might point him to information on depression symptoms in men. You might need some help and support yourself, as well. A counselor can help you understand what he's going through and how to be there for him. They might also suggest ways for you to stay mentally healthy during this difficult time. On the other hand, if you're a man who recognizes some of these symptoms in yourself, talking to a therapist can be helpful in many ways. They can assess your condition and recommend treatments. During therapy, they can teach you new ways to deal with stress, help you learn how to change negative thought patterns, and show you how to avoid aggressive or risky behaviors. Many men find it hard to even think about seeking mental health help. You might believe you need to handle your mental health problems on your own, especially if you're someone who is usually very independent. It's okay to have feelings of doubt. Many people do feel that way the first time they decide to go for therapy. But the benefits of treatment for depression in men far outweigh the discomfort you might feel. Talking to a therapist might not be as hard as you imagine. By talking with a licensed counselor at BetterHelp, you can have therapy in a private setting that you choose. Or, you can go to a mental health counselor where you live if you prefer to see someone a friend recommends in your area. Either way, getting help may be the best move you ever made. With the proper treatment, your symptoms of depression can decrease, you can get your life back on track, and you can enjoy your life again.   ",2022-08-23,Special Groups

A person may feel persistent sadness, hopelessness, or emptiness, decreased energy, loss of interest in activities they once enjoyed, or want to isolate themselves from others. Relationships with family members, friends, and coworkers may be affected. Someone experiencing symptoms of depression may not take care of themselves as they should.

However, these elements are influenced by each other, leaving a drastic effect on a person's thoughts and actions. 11 Signs to Notice When Feeling Depressed When you feel depressed, you may experience one or multiple symptoms of depression. Such feelings are persistent, and it's not easy to shake them off. Since symptoms affect people differently, they should be a red flag to see your doctor or mental health professional. According to the American Psychiatric Association, signs of depression may include the following:   Loss of interest or withdrawal from activities. Many depressed individuals experience a lack of enjoyment of activities they used to look forward to, such as hobbies or hanging out with friends. Some also lack sexual pleasure. Feeling hopeless. Such feelings may include feeling unnecessary guilt or worthlessness. A person may struggle with low self-esteem, blame themselves when it's not their fault, or feel like things are pointless. Few even experience self-hate. Sometimes this symptom is associated with major depression, a form of severe depression. Feeling fatigued or change in sleep patterns. Many lack interest in doing regular activities because they don't have the energy. Some experience insomnia or sleep too much. Lack of proper rest may lead to feeling agitated or anxious. Many that take a depression test or quiz online are asked about energy levels and how they affect their daily activities. Inability to concentrate.

It is common for depression and anxiety to appear together, but anxiety may include symptoms such as heavy sweating, feeling nervous, trouble thinking clearly, rapid breathing, and feeling panicked. Irritability and risky behavior. Depression may appear differently in men than in women. Men may express more anger with irritability. When a person feels irritable, they don't want to be bothered by others. They may find risky behaviors such as substance abuse as a way to escape their feelings. Unexplained aches or pains.

Appetite and weight changes. Depressed individuals may eat more or less, resulting in weight fluctuation. These changes may occur unintentionally. Lack of emotional control.

They will want to know what symptoms you've experienced, for how long, the severity, and if mental illnesses run in your family. They may also want to see if you have a history of drugs or alcohol. Your doctor or mental health professional can then determine a diagnosis and help you to explore treatment options. Why Does Depression Happen? Depression may not have a single cause, but there are factors such as life-changing events, environment, thinking patterns affecting how a person reacts to change, and genetics that may play a role in how symptoms develop. Grieving the loss of a loved one may lead to depression. Living conditions such as homelessness, poverty, or violence may lead to feeling depressed. Hormone changes or unknown medical conditions may contribute to changes in mood and depression. While many people live with depression, depression may be unexplained. Some people have experienced symptoms of depression and can't pinpoint why. Some may not realize something they saw or felt triggered their symptoms.

Other Medical Issues â€“ Medical conditions, including cancer, lupus, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease, are sometimes accompanied by mental health issues such as depression and anxiety.  9 Effective Yoga Poses And Tips To Incorporate Into Your Next Workout  Mental health counselors and therapists often encourage their patients to follow a regular exercise routine to manage their mood. Many people choose yoga for its relaxing but firm teaching style and unique challenges. These yoga poses and tips can help you manage your anxiety and depression, whether you are a beginner student or a seasoned yogi.  Yoga offers both physical and mental health benefits to its students. In a research study published in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine, participants with depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions found that attending a yoga class at least twice a week improved their mood. A regular, 90-minute studio class isn't mandatory-you can practice in your living room, bedroom, or backyard as long as you can fit a session in your schedule and budget. Just 30 minutes of focused yoga can help you manage your mental health and alleviate your anxiety and depression. Either way, maintaining a regular yoga schedule is essential for anyone practicing yoga for depression, anxiety, or other mental health conditions. If you are just starting, make sure you attend beginner yoga classes where you can learn proper techniques and safety tips. Expect soreness from moving your body around in unfamiliar poses after your first several classes.  Take It Easy In Downward-Facing Dog  AdhoMukhaSvanasana â€“ also known as Downward-Facing Dog â€“ allows fresh blood to flow throughout your body. The pose's downward position stretches out the neck and cervical spine, thereby releasing any stress and anxiety you may be holding. Aside from its numerous mental health benefits, Downward Dog also strengthens the upper body muscles, promotes circulation, and improves digestion. Beginners and experts alike can practice different variations of Downward Dog while reaping the same mental health benefits. Students who are still working on their flexibility may need to bend their knees a little. As they continue to practice and improve, they can try more challenging variations such as Downward Dog with a Scorpion Kick or Transverse Twist.  Remember To Keep Breathing  Proper breathwork is essential. Not only does it help you sink deeper into the yoga poses, but it also increases your energy and focus. Pranayama, the practice of controlling one's breath, is often overlooked or forgotten during class. But it is the foundation of both your yoga practice and mental health care routine. When you forget to breathe in yoga class, you risk injuring yourself. So remember to keep taking those deep breaths. You can take many of the breathing techniques you learn in class and incorporate them into your mental health care routine. Practice basic breath awareness by taking a few minutes each day to observe the inhalation and exhalation of air through your nose. Mindful breathing practices such as this one are effective in improving your mental health and helping you focus.  Relieve Your Mind In Child's Pose  Balasana â€“ or Child's Pose â€“ is a resting pose that usually precedes or follows a classic asana pose. For instance, your instructor might have your class rest in Child's Pose for a couple of minutes before popping up to Downward Dog and into a Chaturanga. This temporary rest allows you to breathe, focus, and reset your mind before starting the next sequence. It can also be great for managing your mental health. Many yoga students enjoy Balasana because of its calming effects. As you rest your head on the ground, it becomes easier to relax and focus. Child's Pose can also help you stretch out your hips and relieve any upper back and neck pain.  Pick The Right Yoga Class  Not all yoga classes follow the same teaching style and practices. Hatha is slow-paced and gentle. In an Iyengar class, strict attention to the posture and alignment held in each pose. Vinyasa, on the other hand, focuses on the quick movement between poses to increase body heat. No matter what the teaching style or focus is, yoga classes can improve your mental health. The best yoga class for helping you manage anxiety and depression is the one you enjoy going to the most. Fusion yoga classes such as yogalates, yoga and pilates, and yoga with biking are also starting to grow in popularity. Consider trying one of these classes the next time you feel like changing up your fitness routine. The mental health benefits are still the same, but your body is in for a unique challenge.  Challenge Yourself In Plow Pose  Halasana or Plow Pose stretches out the back, subdues headaches, and blocks insomnia. Many students also find that Plow Pose helps them clear their heads and focus on their mental health. However, Halasana does require a bit of back flexibility. As you lie on your back, you must try to lift your legs over your head and plant your feet onto the ground. You may need to practice simpler back stretches before attempting to tackle the Plow Pose.  Integrate The Meditations Into Your Everyday Life  Manage your mental health by incorporating simple meditations into your daily routine. You can meditate in the morning when you wake up or at night before you fall asleep. Combining yoga and regular meditation can help students recover from a wide array of mental health conditions. As we said before, breathing plays a critical role in your yoga practice. Without breathing, there is no movement. Meditation also requires breathing. Deep, slow breaths allow the mind to focus. Make sure you focus on your breath as you meditate.  Wake Up With Upward-Facing Dog  Upward-Facing Dog, or UrdhvaMukhaSvanasana, is an excellent addition to any yoga routine designed for alleviating mental health conditions. It is also great for strengthening the upper body. As you breathe and relax into the pose, you may feel the stress and tension in your back start to disappear. While you are in the pose, make sure to let your shoulders relax away from your ears. Keep your torso lifted, and the tops of your feet planted firmly in the ground.  Resting Pose  Every yoga class finishes with Savasana. The resting Pose can reduce blood pressure and relax the body after a vigorous class. It can also strengthen the effects of the previous poses, thus increasing the mental health benefits of the class itself. Get In Flow With Your Body And Ease Symptoms Of DepressionBetterHelp Therapits Can Teach You Techniques What Can You Do In Conjunction With Practicing Yoga? Physically speaking, Savasana might be the most natural pose to perform. You lie on the ground with your arms out and palms facing up. By the end of yoga class, you're probably looking forward to the resting pose. Instead, take this time to practice mindfulness and deep breathing techniques. Your mental health will thank you. Yoga offers a wide variety of mental health benefits for both teachers and students. In addition to practicing this popular and fun workout, you may want to reach out to a mental health professional online for guidance on managing anxiety and depression.

Do I Have Postpartum Depression? A Simple Postpartum Depression Quiz,BetterHelp,"While Postpartum Depression was once spoken of in whispers behind closed doors, high-profile cases of the disorder have increasingly brought the disorder to light. This is a vast improvement, as a significant number of women experience some form of postpartum changes to their mental health, such as Postpartum Depression or Postpartum Anxiety. Also, there are resources that can help if you are wondering, ""can online therapy improve postpartum depression?"" What Is Postpartum Depression? Don at Wait To Get Support For Postpartum DepressionSchedule A Therapy Session Online You might be wondering, what is Postpartum Depression? It as a depressive disorder. Its onset follows giving birth, and symptoms usually begin within a few days to a few weeks following birth. Postpartum Depression symptoms mimic typical depressive disorders in the way that it manifests, with a few stark differences that relate specifically to the parent of a child. Although the precise reason for its onset is not known, Postpartum Depression is now recognized as a valid, legitimate disorder that can follow giving birth. There may also be instances of experiencing the condition after adopting, but this is a lesser-studied form of depression. Postpartum depression symptoms typically last for one year or less postpartum, and it is a highly treatable condition. Most Postpartum Depression is considered a minor depressive disorder, but some cases may be severe enough to be classified as a major depressive disorder. Postpartum Depression Versus Postpartum Anxiety Postpartum Depression and Postpartum Anxiety are similar mental health issues, and they may accompany one another. The symptoms associated with each are largely the same, with a few important differences. The similarities between Postpartum Depression symptoms and Postpartum Anxiety symptoms include:  Postpartum onset. Both conditions begin following the birth of a child. They may affect both parents but are more common among mothers. If depression or anxiety began prior to birth, it is not considered a postpartum disorder. Increased levels of anxiety. Postpartum Depression and Postpartum Anxiety feature increased stress levels, including the fear that parenting ability is inadequate, and that a child will not be appropriately cared for. Sleep changes. Both Postpartum Anxiety and Depression often demonstrate significant sleep changes as part of their symptom set. Postpartum Depression is typically characterized by an increased need to sleep, or feelings of exhaustion, while Postpartum Anxiety is more often characterized by trouble sleeping due to high levels of fear or worry.  Postpartum Depression symptoms also contain elements that Postpartum Anxiety symptoms do not, the most significant of which happen when thoughts of harming oneself or harming one's child have occurred. Although Postpartum Anxiety might suggest to a parent that a child will be harmed â€” Postpartum Depression suggests that a child might be harmed by the parent, an important distinction that can help differentiate between Postpartum Depression and Postpartum Anxiety. This distinction is important, too, because it allows clinicians to more effectively and clearly deduce whether a parent is going through postpartum depression. Symptoms of Postpartum Depression  It's important to note that postpartum Depression symptoms may be obscured by the hormonal changes following pregnancy and birth. Still, there are definite symptoms associated with the condition, which can be evaluated by a mental health care professional. Postpartum Depression symptoms include:  Depressed mood. Although sadness is common following birth, as are feelings of overwhelm, persistent depressed mood is a sign of depression, rather than simple hormonal changes or sadness. Difficulty with or inability to bond with your baby. Mothers and children experience significant bonding behaviors in the weeks and months following birth. Mothers typically experience feelings of excitement, closeness, and a desire to protect and nurture their children. When the Postpartum Depression is present, though, the ability to bond is impaired, which can interfere with developing closeness and protective mechanisms. Fatigue and loss of energy. Although there is undoubtedly some fatigue common to new parentsâ€”newborns sleep only 2-3 hours or less at a timeâ€”typical fatigue is mitigated by sleep and rest. Fatigue that is not improved by sleep or rest may be a sign of postpartum depression. Feeling shameful, guilty, or inadequate. While some amount of concern is normal for a new parent, it is not typical to feel as though you are incapable of caring for your child, nor is it typical to feel shameful or guilty about any perceived lack of ability. These feelings can indicate that depression is at play. The desire to harm yourself or your baby. This is, arguably, one of the most distressing symptoms to new parents, as it can be frightening to experience thoughts of self-harm, or thoughts of harming your child. This symptom can also make it difficult to seek help. It is essential to know that this is a product of depression, though, rather than a legitimate desire to harm.  Is It Postpartum Depression? Don at Wait To Get Support For Postpartum DepressionSchedule A Therapy Session Online The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists suggests that new mothers get screened for postpartum depression at least once during the perinatal period. Depression tests are confidential and covered by most health insurance providers. Although Postpartum Depression is a condition that needs to be diagnosed by a professional, there are some questions you can ask yourself to determine whether you are at risk for developing or having the disorder. These include:  A family history of Postpartum Depression. One of the greatest risk factors for developing Postpartum Depression is a family history of Postpartum Depression. Unfortunately, because this disorder was not always widely discussed or diagnosed, having a mother or grandmother with the condition might not be as familiar. Nevertheless, family history can still play a role, and even having a sibling with the diagnosis can provide a window into risk factors. A family history of mood disorders. If there is not a family history of Postpartum Depression, but there are instances of mood disorders in your family, such as General Anxiety Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, or others, you are at higher risk for developing the condition. Although the exact mechanisms of this are not known, there is a consistent link between family histories of mental illness and mental disorders and younger generations also possessing those disorders. Are your hormone levels altered? In some cases, mood changes following pregnancy are caused by fluctuating hormones; during pregnancy, and after birth, the human body contains a veritable cocktail of intense hormonal reactions, many of which are capable of producing intense and unexpected mental and emotional effects. Working with a general practitioner to test hormone levels can be one step in determining whether or not you are at risk for Postpartum Depression.  If any of the above questions apply to you, your likelihood of developing Postpartum Depression is substantially increased.  From there, a quick glance over depressive symptoms and the timing of their onset can further elucidate the likelihood of Postpartum Depression. These symptoms include:  Intense feelings of sadness. Some sadness is normal after delivery. The ""baby blues"" is a term that describes the hormonal changes and corresponding sadness that accompanies the transition from pregnancy to parenthood. When the feelings associated with the baby blues persist for more than a week or two and/or become worse, this is a sign of postpartum depression. Thoughts of harm. Postpartum Depression is marked by thoughts of self-harm and bringing harm to your child. This is one of the most prominent and easily recognized symptoms of Postpartum Depression. Disrupted patterns of eating and sleeping. Depression causes disrupted patterns of eating and sleeping, such as increased or decreased appetite, and an increased desire to or need for sleep. Persistent despair, without discernible cause. A mother who has experienced loss will feel pain and despair, and may not be experiencing Postpartum Depression, but may instead be experiencing grief. Conversely, a mother who has not experienced loss following birth and feels pain and despair may be experiencing a symptom of Postpartum Depression.  Although there are more symptoms related to Postpartum Depression, answering positively to any of the points above could indicate the need to connect with a mental health professional. Because getting out of the house with a newborn can be difficult, there are online talk therapy platforms, such as BetterHelp, designed to make getting support easier for individuals in need of intervention from the comfort and safety of home. If you're ready to speak with a mental health professional about depression, life with a baby, or any other mental health concerns, BetterHelp is an affordable, convenient option. Treating Postpartum Depression  If your answers to a postpartum depression test indicate that treatment is encouraged, there are several options. Postpartum Depression is often treated using a two-pronged approach but may even be a 3-pronged approach. Therapy is typically recommended for a woman coping with Postpartum Depression. The precise duration and frequency with which therapy is administered will usually depend on the severity of the mental health problem. Medication is often also recommended for individuals with postpartum depression, to help manage the symptoms, and create greater freedom for new parents striving to create a safe, healthy home environment. In addition to utilizing the help of a doctor or other medical professional who can prescribe medication, some therapists may enlist the services of practitioners who can implement dietary and lifestyle changes to support healing. It can also help to have your partner, friends, or family members help care for the baby. Many women feel uncomfortable relying on their partners or other adults to support them and care for their child; but coping with mental health concerns while caring for a baby can make any woman feel overwhelmed. Note that other, more intense forms of Postpartum Depression, such as Postpartum Psychosis, will require more significant treatment and intervention. Although they only make up about 1% of new mothers, Postpartum Psychosis can develop and is essentially a more aggravated form of the disorder. Nevertheless, postpartum conditions are considered highly treatable and typically abate within a year of the date of birth. Whether you are experiencing mild symptoms or severe symptoms, the onset of Postpartum Depression symptoms can make new mothers feel frightened, isolated, and broken. If you match any of the descriptors listed above or fear the way that you feel or think, do not hesitate to reach out for help. You can speak to a therapist for advice and support or find treatment facilities through the Treatment Services Locator page, available on the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's section of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services site. No matter how you feel today, you can get the treatment you need to free yourself of the symptoms of depression. Questions People Commonly Ask On This Topic: What is a positive EPDS score? The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale is a test that measures the likelihood that a person has postpartum depression. The test has a maximum score of 30. Each box within every question corresponds to a different score. For example, if the answer to question 4â€”""I have been anxious or worried for no good reason""â€”is ""No, not at all,"" the score for that answer is a 0. If the answer is ""Hardly ever"" it is a 1, ""Yes, sometimes"" is a 2, and ""Yes, very often"" is a 3. The combination of all the scores based on the answers provided gives you the total score. According to the scale (Cox, J.L.; Holden, J.M.; Sagovsky, R; British Journal of Psychiatry, 1987), women are at risk of depression if they score a 13 or above, and a score of 10 or above describes ""possible depression.""What is a high depression score? A high depression score depends on the specific test that was taken. For example, a score of 13 or above on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale is considered high enough for depression to potentially be present. On other scales, however, this score describes a person who is likely not living with depression. It's often necessary to bring your results to a mental health professional who can interpret the test properly. A depression screening can help you determine whether you need to seek treatment. These tests are usually confidential and will typically be covered by health insurance. You can also find free depression tests online (though these should not be used to self-diagnose). If you receive a high score on a depression scale, there are many treatment options available. You can contact a mental health professional or seek out treatment facilities. To find treatment facilities near you, contact your primary care physician or conduct a search on the Treatment Services Locator page, available on the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's site.",2022-09-05,Diagnosis
Symptoms Of Depression In Men: What To Watch Out For,BetterHelp,"Although depression tends to include some common symptoms, not everyone may experience depression the same way. For example, the symptoms of depression in some men may not be the same as those experienced by some women. It as Okay To Talk About Your FeelingsGet Depression Support For Men In Therapy Although depression does not discriminate based on gender (as millions of Americans are coping with this mental health issue), men may experience some different symptoms than women. The good news is that you can receive the help that you need to recover from depression once you recognize the signs. If you are a male who believes you may have depression, let's take a look at some of the symptoms of depression in men to understand better what your personal experience may look like (and how you can treat it once it is recognized and diagnosed). Symptoms of Depression in Men: How Does It Differ From Depression in Women? Before we dive deeper into the varying depressive experience for men, it is essential to evaluate depression as a whole, what forms of depression there are, and how each of them may impact your mental health differently. If you believe you may have depression, here is more information on what depression is and the signs. What Is Depression? Depression is a mood disorder that impacts our ability to function in our day-to-day lives and fills those affected with feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and helplessness (along with physical manifestations of these emotional symptoms). The severity of your depression will vary depending upon the type of depression itself and how it impacts your mental health, which we will cover further in the section below. What Types of Depression Are There? The most commonly referenced form of depression is major depressive disorder, which will often last several months and feature the typical symptoms of depression throughout the episode, for which symptoms can range from mild to severe. However, major depressive disorder is not the only type of mood disorder that can impact your mental health. Some other notable forms of depression include:   Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia): Persistent depressive disorder, also known as Dysthymic Disorder or dysthymia, is a long-term form of depression that can last for two years or more and features low-grade depressive symptoms. Those experiencing this type of depression may not notice any significant changes to their mental health. Most are still able to function while dealing with their minor (yet quite impactful) symptoms. This type of depression in men may also be difficult to diagnose if a male is not actively seeking help for their symptoms or does not believe that they are struggling with their mental health. Bipolar Disorder (Manic Depression): Bipolar disorder is often associated with the manic highs that someone experiences when diagnosed (although there are other forms of bipolar disorder). This mood disorder is typically accompanied by periods of extremely low moods that meet the criteria of major depression and have a detrimental impact on mental health. Because bipolar disorder can act far differently from other forms of depression in men, they must look out for the symptoms of bipolar disorder and seek immediate help if they believe they may have it. If the symptoms are severe enough, hospitalization to preserve mental health may be necessary, and a suicide prevention plan should be in place. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255 and is available 24 hours every day. Psychotic Depression: Sometimes, mental health can be impacted by coexisting disorders, such as psychotic depression. In those with psychotic depression, symptoms of severe depression are accompanied by delusions or hallucinations associated with psychotic episodes. As it is with these severe forms of depression, having a suicide prevention plan and a current course of treatment is essential so that the individual dealing with the disorder does not feel helpless when coping with their symptoms. Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD): Aptly named, Seasonal Affective Disorder is a form of depression that often manifests during the winter months when there is less sunlight. The good news is that this type of depression will generally end by spring once the sun comes back out, and life returns to normal. While this may not seem as serious as other forms of depression on this list, it can still impact your mental health and is still very important to recognize.  Although you may not experience all of the forms of depression, it is essential to know which kinds of depression are out there. You must be able to recognize which type you may have, how it impacts your mental health, how you can focus on treatment and suicide prevention, and how you can move forward from here. What Are the Symptoms of Depression? In general, the symptoms you may experience when dealing with a depressive episode are mostly similar across all depressive disorders (except those that feature other mental health disorders in them). Some of the most common symptoms of depression include:  A feeling of hopelessness, helplessness, and sadness that impacts the individual with depression for most of the duration of the depressive episode Feeling anxious, empty, or numb Feeling guilty or worthless and having low self-esteem Low energy and fatigue Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much Trouble eating or eating too much Difficulty thinking or concentrating Slower movements and speech Agitation and irritability Low or no interest in activities that previously interested the individual with depression Aches and pains throughout the body that have no cause and are resistant against traditional treatment methods Suicidal thoughts and actions (if you believe that you are at risk of committing suicide, you must reach out for help immediately and develop a suicide prevention plan for any future depressive episodes. As mentioned earlier, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255, and is available 24 hours every day.)  Now that we've tackled some of the main symptoms of depression and how they can impact someone's mental health let's look at how these symptoms match up with depression symptoms in men. It as Okay To Talk About Your FeelingsGet Depression Support For Men In Therapy How Is Depression in Men Different From Depression in Women? Mental health issues such as depression will often manifest differently in different genders due to several varying factors. While there is no apparent cause behind these different experiences, men may uniquely deal with depression because of variables such as hormones, societal expectations, genes, or environmental stress. As a result, depression may not be as clearly seen or diagnosed for men as it is for women. Some of the most common symptoms of depression in men include:  Men will often express more aggressive behaviors and become irritable and angry when dealing with this mental health disorder. This behavior may also lead to males becoming controlling or violent in their relationships with others. As it is with depression, men may noticeably withdraw from people and activities that once brought pleasure to them, which can often be easier to see from the outside. Isolation is often one of the main symptoms of depression in men and may clarify a mental health disorder. Depression in men may manifest in physical symptoms such as an inability to perform sexually or a less active sex drive, which can be frustrating to those affected. Men may engage in more risky coping mechanisms to deal with the mental health disorder, such as drinking more, using drugs, engaging in risky or unprotected sex, or gambling, to name a few.  While this is a relatively short list of symptoms that can be unique to the male experience, it is important to note that these symptoms are often accompanied by the symptoms of depression provided in the previous section. These symptoms are merely some of the most common within males that will reveal mental health disorders like depression in men. Additionally, like the symptoms above, men may not experience all of these symptoms when dealing with depression. These are simply some of the most prominent warning signs to look out for if you believe that you may be dealing with depression. What to Do If You Notice Some of These Symptoms of Depression in Men If you believe that any of the symptoms above are impacting your mental health, the good news is that you are not alone, and treatment is always available to help you get through this difficult time. The most critical first step to take for your mental health if you believe you are dealing with depression is to realize that it's okay you feel this way. It's important to note that you shouldn't blame yourself. Face your feelings (instead of avoiding them), so that you can then seek treatment. The next crucial step is to reach out to a counselor. A licensed counselor can help you work through your mental health disorder symptoms, provide you with valuable coping mechanisms, and give you the support you need as you work through your depression. Although traditional face-to-face counseling is one effective option to consider, online counseling can also be an effective way to deal with your depression symptoms. For example, BetterHelp is an online counseling resource that allows you to easily connect with licensed counselors online, from the comfort and privacy of your own home. If you have limited resources in your area, have a busy schedule, or simply want to receive counseling from your home, BetterHelp can be an excellent resource to improve your mental health.  Additionally, you may supplement talk therapy with medication to help you return to a more stable mood as you work through the symptoms of depression. Remember, if you are currently dealing with suicidal thoughts and believe that you may be at risk of harming yourself, it is important that you reach out to an emergency suicide prevention resource to get the immediate help that you need. Although things can seem negative at the moment, there is always hope for the future. While mental health disorders like depression come with a set of symptoms to look out for, not all symptoms present themselves in the same way across different individuals. As you've seen above, the symptoms of depression in men may look different than they would in women. If you are a male who has related to some of the symptoms and descriptions provided above, it's important you realize that you are not alone. You can reach out for help at any time.

How To Know If I Have Clinical Depression Symptoms,BetterHelp,"For many people, grief over the loss of a loved one is their first brush with depression. Most anyone can have a short period of depression. If you've just found out that you have a serious illness, you may experience depression. Those who have a thyroid problem may experience a bit of depression due to hormonal changes. A bad breakup or divorce can bring on depression symptoms. You'll be happy to know that none of these situations necessarily leads to clinical depression. However, if your feelings of sadness start to go deeper and darker, and it last for months, you may have clinical depression symptoms. Treatment For Clinical Depression Is AvailableFind The Right Treatment For You In Therapy The only way to know for sure is to have an evaluation by a therapist. No one has to go through clinical depression because it's a mental health disorder where treatment can be quite effective. Learning More About Clinical Depression The symptoms of depression range from mild to severe, and they can be temporary or long-lasting. Clinical depression is also referred to as major depression or major depressive disorder, and it's a more severe type of depression than temporary sadness that doesn't prevent you from participating in your daily activities. Clinicians rely on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association for the criteria to diagnose someone with clinical depression symptoms. Depression symptoms must be present for at least two weeks to be considered clinical depression. Clinical depression is a serious mood disorder because it interferes with normal functioning. People with depression experience symptoms that affect how they feel, think, and handle their daily lives. The symptoms of depression often interfere with sleep, diet, and work. Certain types of depression develop under specific, unique circumstances. Persistent Depressive Disorder A persistent depressive disorder is also called dysthymia. This type of depression requires the presence of symptoms of depression that last for at least two years. The persistent depressive disorder causes symptoms that alternate with major depression along with periods of less severe symptoms. This diagnosis holds as long as the symptoms continue for at least two years. Postpartum Depression After a woman gives birth, her body goes through hormonal swings. The changes in hormone levels can create depressive symptoms or anxiety in some women. The symptoms, which are commonly known as the baby blues, are usually mild and disappear after about two weeks as the body returns to normal. For some women, the hormonal levels don't automatically stabilize. Postpartum depression can turn into clinical depression, making it difficult for new mothers to care for themselves and their babies. Psychotic Depression Severe depression can sometimes be accompanied by psychosis. Psychosis symptoms sometimes have a theme, such as delusions of poverty, illness, or guilt. People with psychotic depression have fixed beliefs, including delusions, where they hear or see things that others can't.  Seasonal Affective Disorder Another type of unique depression is a seasonal affective disorder or SAD. People with depression where symptoms only appear during winter months when there is less natural sunlight may be diagnosed with SAD. The symptoms nearly always disappear during the warmer months. Bipolar Disorder Bipolar disorder is a bit different than clinical depression because it's mixed with periods of euphoria. The depression part of bipolar disorder meets the DSM criteria for depression, which is called bipolar depression. The depression alternates with extreme highs called mania, or hypomania. Learning More About the Symptoms Of Depression People with depression have symptoms that cause problems in their relationships and can cause serious problems in other areas of their lives, such as at work or school. Clinical depression doesn't discriminate. It can affect anyone, from young children to senior citizens. If you notice any of the following symptoms of depression in yourself or someone else, it's best to get a mental health evaluation.  Feeling extremely sad, teary, empty, pessimistic, or hopeless Being angry, irritable, frustrated, even over small things Losing interest in things you normally enjoy Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much Feeling tired, having no energy, feeling fatigued most days Lack of appetite, weight loss or weight gain Feeling anxious and restless Sluggishness in thought or movements Blaming self, feeling worthless Can't think clearly, trouble with focus and making decisions Thinking about death, having suicidal thoughts or attempts Having unusual aches, pains, or digestive problems  Despite the seriousness and severity of clinical depression symptoms, the prognosis to treat depression is good. Most people improve with psychological counseling. Some psychiatrists also recommend adding an anti-depressant medication, but these medications can come with side-effects, which can sometimes be serious. Are Certain Populations More At Risk For Clinical Depression? According to the Anxiety Depression Association of America (ADAA), anxiety and depression disorders are the most common mental health disorders in the United States. Around 40 million adults, or just over 18% of the population, have some sort of anxiety disorder; yet, only about 37% of those that experience it take steps to treat depression. Depression may result from a variety of things, including genetics, individual brain chemistry, personality, or life challenges. Depression may accompany other health serious health conditions like diabetes, cancer, heart disease, or Parkinson's disease. Clinical depression symptoms can make physical conditions worse. Medications that people take to cure physical conditions may have side-effects that cause or contribute to clinical depression symptoms. For complex medical and mental health conditions, it's best to work with a physician that has experience in treating complex conditions. The main risk factors for clinical depression are having a family history of depression, dealing with major life changes that cause stress, and having certain physical illnesses that require medications. How To Treat Clinical Depression Perhaps one of the best-known things about clinical depression is that, with the right treatment protocol, even the very worst cases of clinical depression are highly treatable. At the same time, it's important to consider that there's no single treatment for clinical depression that works for everyone. Many clients with clinical depression find that it takes a bit of trial and error before they find the treatment modality that works best for them. People with depression that seek treatment early, when symptoms first present, have the best chance at a successful recovery. Treatment For Clinical Depression Is AvailableFind The Right Treatment For You In Therapy Most often, the treatments for depression are psychotherapy, medication, or both. There are some other types of treatments like electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), which is a brain stimulation therapy that some people consider when nothing else seems to be working. Johns Hopkins cautions that ECT can cause memory loss. Herbal and alternative medications may help reduce symptoms of depression. However, just because they're natural supplements doesn't necessarily mean that they're safe to use. People that have depression should review all dietary supplements and non-prescriptive medications that they're taking with their medical providers. Certain natural supplements can have dangerous side-effects when combined with certain prescription drugs. Some of the natural or botanical supplements are currently being studied for their potential benefits in treating depression. To date, none of them have been approved for safe routine use. Psychotherapy For Clinical Depression Treatment Has Proven To Be Effective The National Institute of Mental Health offers reliable information on psychotherapy for clinical depression. Therapists may use one approach and add elements from other types of therapy based on the patient's symptoms and severity of the depression. Evidence-based psychotherapies for clinical depression include cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy (IPT), and problem-solving therapy. Psychotherapy helps people living with depression to become aware of negative thought patterns. Through talk therapy, patients learn to question their thoughts and understand how their thoughts affect their feelings and behavior. This understanding forms the basis for changing thoughts and behavior. Part of psychotherapy may include helping people find ways to cope with stress and find ways to relax, such as practicing meditation or mindfulness. Therapy also helps people to explore their interactions with others and coach them on improving their social and communication skills. Some therapists ask their patients to track their emotions and activities so they can compare the two. For people that have suicidal ideations, a therapist can assist in safety planning by helping them recognize the warning signs and encouraging them to use coping strategies and ask for help.  Taking Care Of Your Physical Health Improves Clinical Depression Symptoms Doing your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle goes a long way toward supporting treatment for clinical depression. It helps to exercise and be active. Spend time in the company of other people that you trust. Resist the temptation to hide away and allow others to help you. Try to take note of gradual improvements in your mood. Put off making any major decisions in your life, such as getting married or divorced, having children, or making a major purchase until you feel more emotionally stable. Your primary care practitioner is a good place to start if you think that you may be dealing with clinical depression. You might also consider online therapy as an option for getting your symptoms of clinical depression under control. The important thing is to pursue some type of help so that you can begin feeling better at the earliest opportunity.",2022-08-24,Diagnosis
Cures For Depression: What Treatment Is Best For Me?,BetterHelp,"Whether you are experiencing depression or you suspect that you are, this is something that you should seek treatment for as soon as you can. There are options available to you to get the help you need, and when you are proactive about your health, there is a higher chance for recovery. Keep reading this article for information on the different types of treatment out there. Depression Treatment Is Not One Size Fits AllGet Personalized Care From A Therapist What Is Depression? Depression is a condition that can be different depending on who is experiencing it. However, there are a few things that are generally the same in most cases. Depression usually causes you to feel negative feelings about yourself and life in general. It can also keep you from doing things that you love, and can affect your relationships, even the closest ones. In other words, it tends to seep into every aspect of your life and cause negative consequences. Below we'll discuss different types of depression. Major Depression This type of depression is perhaps the most serious. If you are experiencing it, you may have constant feelings of sadness or despair. Moreover, you may not have the motivation or energy to do even the most mundane of tasks. It's important to seek help if you are feeling a complete lack of motivation. Minor Depression This is a less severe form of depression, but it still can affect your daily life quite a bit. It involves the same symptoms but is generally less severe. The symptoms will also go away quicker than with other types of depression. Note that simply because this type is less serious, doesn't mean it should not be treated. Postpartum Depression This is the type of depression that can take place after a mother gives birth to a child. Throughout the gestation process, a woman experiences many changes in her hormones, and once the baby comes out, these hormones keep changing. This can lead to changes in mood and behavior, while a mom gets over the miracle of birth, and her body starts to heal and get back to normal.  Having a newborn can lead to you not being able to get enough sleep and not being able to eat the nutritious meals that you need, which may exacerbate this issue. However, this condition is treatable, similar to how other types of depression are treatable. Symptoms Depression symptoms can be different for everyone, but if you notice that you have many of these symptoms, it is recommended that you seek professional help.  Sadness or feeling like you're in a bad mood often Changes in eating Weight changes Having no energy Sleeping significantly more or less Inability to concentrate Unable to make any decisions Little to no interest in many aspects of life Feeling like you want to hurt yourself  It's important to note that your feelings are valid, and you should never blame yourself for these symptoms. However, it is your responsibility to begin the healing process. Depression Vs. Sadness Depression is much different from sadness or grief. Being sad and grieving is a normal part of life. When you lose someone or something tragic happens to you, it may cause some of the same symptoms as depression. However, this is to be expected. These symptoms will likely go away after you've processed your emotions. There's no timeline for being sad after a major change in life, so give yourself some time to heal. Risk Factors There isn't an official cause of depression, but there are things that are thought to be risk factors for developing it. Your health information may also indicate if you are going to develop depression in your lifetime. Genes It is thought that genes play a part in someone experiencing depression. If someone that is in your family has it, you may get it as well. Depression Treatment Is Not One Size Fits AllGet Personalized Care From A Therapist Environment When you grow up in a situation where there are feelings that you will never overcome what has happened to you, this can lead to depression. Brain Chemistry At times, there may be an imbalance with chemicals in your brain. This can lead to the onset of certain disorders, including depression. Your History When you have no feelings of self-worth or generally don't think you are good enough, this might translate to depression. Keep in mind that you don't have to feel abnormal if you have one or more of these risk factors. It is more important to remember that there is help out there, so you can start to feel better and find happiness in activities that you used to enjoy. Treatments There are a few different options when it comes to depression treatment. For the most part, these can be used in combination with one another and need to be monitored to make sure that they are helping and not harming. Psychotherapy All types of depression can be treated with psychotherapy. This is when you simply talk to a licensed mental health professional about your life and start to work through your problems. This is a good first step, and it can significantly alter how you feel about yourself once you start to talk to someone outside of your support system. Make sure you tell any type of doctor you work with about your health information, so they will know how to treat you properly. If you do not have access to traditional, in-person counselors nearby, you may want to consider online counseling platforms. For example, BetterHelp has licensed counselors who are available to speak with you, from the comfort and safety of your own home. Online therapy can be just as effective as in-person therapy for treating depression. In fact, a study done by the Berkeley Well-Being Institute found BetterHelp to be as effective as face-to-face therapy, with 70% of people showing reduced depression symptoms. Medication Certain prescriptions may help you cope with symptoms related to depression, as well. Research suggests that the combination of psychotherapy and medication may be more effective than seeking either treatment by itself. You should always consult with your primary care provider before seeking medication. Other Things You Can Do There are some things you can do at your home, which can assist you in lowering stress and might be able to help you heal faster. These are things that are good for your overall health and can be easy to incorporate into your routine. These options are not a depression treatment, but they can be positive things for you to start doing.  If you can start exercising a few times a week, this can be a mood booster for you. It can also improve your physical health. Research shows that exercise can be an effective treatment option for depression symptoms. Taking time for you. When you are feeling too stressed or out of sorts, you need to take time for yourself, even if it is just a few minutes. Perhaps you can take a relaxing bath or read your favorite book. Getting proper sleep. Your body needs sleep to renew itself each night. When you deprive it of sleep, this can lead to you not feeling your best. A lack of sleep can also make depression symptoms worse. Eating right. Take the time to plan your meals so that you can eat better. Eating healthy meals will improve the uptake of necessary vitamins and minerals, which can have positive effects on your mood. Limiting alcohol. If alcohol leaves you feeling emotional or sad, it is a good idea to limit how much you are drinking.   Is There A Cure? There is not a catch-all cure for depression, but there is hope for anyone going through it. With the proper treatment, your symptoms can be managed, and in many cases, they may disappear completely over time. Many times, treatment occurs for many years at a time, so if you seek treatment for several years before you see a significant improvement, this is nothing to be ashamed of. Treatment will work differently for everyone and needs to be adjusted regularly, for the best outcome. Overview Different treatments can help lessen the symptoms of depression, even in severe cases. There is no way to know for sure what the proper treatment for your case is, without you first visit a doctor or mental health professional. They will be able to do tests and check your health information and can determine the next steps. With the proper treatment, you can be cured of depression. You should always feel comfortable with your treatments, so don't hesitate to tell your doctor if treatment doesn't seem to be working. Many people with depression see a decrease in their symptoms, but it might never fully go away. That's why there are so many resources that you can take advantage of, which can allow you to live your life in a fulfilling, healthy way. Take the time to watch out for yourself and seek out the help you need.

What is the Difference Between Depression and Anxiety,BetterHelp,"Depression and Anxiety â€“ not quite siblings but at least distant relatives in the mental health world. The truth is that although depression and anxiety are two different medical conditions, their symptoms, causes, and treatments can often overlap. You are More Than Your Depression And Anxiety DiagnosesGet Supportive Help From A Therapist What Is The Difference Between Depression And Anxiety? Chances are if you ask someone to name two common mental health problems, they will respond with anxiety and depression. Commercials on anxiety and depression medication are commonplace in today's world, and movie stars to actors and actresses are seemingly very open about their struggles with anxiety and depression. Yet, it can be assumed that many people truly don't know the difference between the two. It's as if they are the same. They're not, exactly. Despite the fact that they are commonly referenced in conversation, people still struggle sometimes to determine the difference between these two conditions. This is because many people with anxiety also develop depression and vice versa. Roughly 50% of people diagnosed with depression will also be diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. Symptoms Of Depression Depression, versus having a bad day or feeling unhappy over a bad grade or a breakup, is characterized by longer and deeper feelings of despondency and the presence of certain characteristic symptoms as shown here:  Depressed Mood â€“ Feeling a bit down from time to time is normal. Most people experience events in their life that cause them to feel sad and sorrowful periodically. Facing loss or disappointment can bring a person's mood down, but this is a temporary downcast feeling, and the person most likely eventually feels better. However, with depression, a depressed mood is much more than sadness or low mood and lasts much longer. Physical discomfort may also accompany the depressed mood, as well as difficulty sleeping, and a lack of appetite and energy. Lack Of Interest â€“ A person who is experiencing depression usually has little to no motivation to do the activities they used to love doing. The desire and enthusiasm have been drastically decreased. Just thinking about going to the gym, meeting friends for a Sunday matinÃ©e, or taking a nice long hike through the woods can be arduous. They'd more likely rather stay inside their place, lie on the couch, or even stay in bed all day. Increase Or Decrease In Appetite â€“ Some people overeat and gain weight, turning to food to lift their mood. People with depression will often use food to self-medicate, eating to either bring a sense of comfort or to mask the feelings of sadness and shame that often accompany depression. Others experience a decrease in their appetite due to the exhausting effects of depression, and therefore they don't have the energy nor desire to prepare meals or eat at all. Insomnia Or Hypersomnia â€“ Insomnia and depression often go hand-in-hand. Although just 15% of people with depression sleep more than the average person does, as many as 80% have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. Patients with persistent insomniaare more than three times more likely to develop depression. Hypersomnia, on the other hand, is characterized by recurrent episodes of excessive daytime sleepiness or prolonged nighttime sleep. Different from feeling tired due to a lack of, or interrupted sleep at night, people with hypersomnia are compelled to nap repeatedly during the day, often at inappropriate times such as at work, during a meal, or in conversation.    Lack Of Energy â€“ People with depression often report a constant feeling of fatigue. In addition to the overall lack of motivation and change in diet and appetite, the effects of insomnia or hypersomnia may also play a part in having a lack of energy. Accompanying levels of stress due to trying to make it through the day at work or feel shame for not being present with the kids can affect levels of serotonin and dopamine, which are chemicals in the brain that play an essential part in regulating mood and energy. Feelings of Guilt â€“ The idea of not being the energetic and involved parent, friend, or spouse can bring up feelings of guilt or worthlessness in a person struggling with depression. Lying in bed instead of making the kids' lunches, having no desire to play ball with their child, or not being intimately available emotionally or physically with a partner can increase feelings of guilt and shame. Trouble Concentrating â€“ Sometimes referred to as brain fog, people with depression often experience trouble concentrating. This might include difficulty paying attention, lack of memory, delayed verbal response time, and problems with making decisions. Suicidal thoughts or behaviors â€“ In severe cases, depression can be life-threatening, with suicidal thoughts or behaviors.  If you or someone you know is experiencing suicidal thoughts, help is available. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline can be reached at 1-800-273-8255 and is available 24/7, or you can text the word ""HOME"" to 741741 to reach the Crisis Text Line. Symptoms Of Generalized Anxiety Disorder Occasional anxiety is a normal part of life. It's common for people at one time or another to worry about things like health, money, or family problems. In fact, it's built into our bodily system in a process called the ""fight-or-flight"" response, which prepares us to confront or flee any potential threats physically. But it's more than that for people with a generalized anxiety disorder. They have a constant feeling of worry about what can sometimes add up to many different things, even if there is no cause for concern. Here are some common symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder:  Excessive Worry â€“ People struggling with generalized anxiety disorder have excessive, heightened worry about many different things, like job security, job performance, their health, and their family's health, finances, and showing up late to work or appointments. For someone who's not struggling with generalized anxiety disorder, these heightened worries would rarely cross there mind. But with someone with generalized anxiety disorder, the constant worry about these types of issues can affect them to the point of disrupting their daily life, making it difficult to merely function. Restlessness â€“ When someone experiences generalized anxiety disorder, their nervous system has no sense of moderation. It can't distinguish between benign worries and life-or-death situations. As a result, it will trigger a massive release of hormones like adrenaline and cortisol into the body, thereby heightening sensations of alertness and wakefulness, so the person can immediately respond to the threat. It's these feelings of alertness and hypervigilance that are mainly responsible for the feelings of restlessness. Other feelings of restlessness are caused by the non-ending cycle of worry that constantly spins throughout the mind of someone with anxiety. Fatigue â€“ The mind of a person dealing with generalized anxiety disorder can sometimes feel like it's continuously going 100 mph without rest in sight. They may appear fidgety, restless, or irritable, but day after day, month after month of rarely slowing down mentally and emotionally, is the main reason why fatigue with people with anxiety disorders is also themain symptom. Lack Of Memory And Difficulty Concentrating â€“ Generalized anxiety disorder strongly affects our working memory, also known as short-term memory, which is critical for people to solve problems and process information in the present effectively. When the working memory is not operating at normal levels, it can lead to a person making mistakes, difficulty concentrating, and problems with multitasking. Change In Appetite â€“ A person with a generalized anxiety disorder may experience either an increase of appetite or a decrease of appetite. One of the reasons there is an increase in appetite that a person may turn to food for comfort when dealing with stress and anxiety. The decrease in appetite is mainly due to the sudden rush of stress hormones that trigger the ""fight-or-flight"" response. Researchsuggests that one of the hormones â€“ corticotropin-releasing factor â€“ may lead to the suppression of a person's appetite.   Anger And Irritability â€“ A person dealing with anxiety disorders for a prolonged period more likely can't handle one more bad job review, another poor medical result, or another, well, anything. In other words, they have less tolerance for additional stress and mental energy, and the anger and irritability is a result of this. Sleep Disturbance â€“ The sleep disturbance caused by chronic anxiety disorders is a vicious cycle. Your mind starts racing and worrying about a million different things, and you can't fall asleep. And when you do, chances are your quality sleep is minimal. You wake up exhausted and fatigued, only to begin worrying that night about whether you'll get a good night's sleep. Muscle Tension â€“ When muscles are tightened and stressed over an elongated period, it can cause tension in the muscles and other parts of the body. A person with a generalized anxiety disorder is likely to experience panic attacks, and muscles become tense during a panic attack. They can cause feelings of stiffness and tension throughout the body, even long after the attack has subsided.  Comparing the two lists of symptoms â€“ depression, and anxiety â€“ it's apparent that there is some overlap. Sleep problems, trouble concentrating, and fatigue are all symptoms of both depression and anxiety. There are, however, some distinguishing features. People with depression have a lack of energy and are fatigued while people with anxiety tend to be more worked up and nervous as thoughts race through their minds. However, people with both anxiety and depression can have these symptoms. People with anxiety have worries, oftentimes unsubstantiated, about the future. In contrast, people struggling with depression are less likely to be concerned about future events because the future is often viewed as hopeless and almost non-existent.

How To Improve Symptoms of Depression: 7 Helpful Steps,BetterHelp,"Everyone can feel down sometimes.  The loss of a loved one can lead to sadness.  A break up can create that feeling of sadness too.  Moving away from family and friends can also contribute to feelings of sadness. Most of the time, we bounce back and achieve a sense of normalcy in time. However, in people with depression, the feelings of grief become overwhelming, cause physical symptoms, and last for long periods. As a result, they can keep you from leading a normal, active life. In fact, depression can sometimes put you into such a gloom that even the everyday activities can be affected, sometimes to a point where you become emotionally and mentally paralyzed. What Is The Definition Of Depression? You Don at Have To Get Over Depression AloneGet Support From A Licensed Therapist Depression is a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest. Also called a major depressive disorder or clinical depression, it affects how you feel, think, and behave, and can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems. You may have trouble doing normal day-to-day activities, and sometimes, in extreme cases, a person may experience utmost hopelessness. What Are The Symptoms Of Depression?

It affects millions of people, including some that may be in your life, like family, friends, and neighbors, and you may not realize they face similar challenges, emotions, and obstacles. It may appear as if their life is well put together and that they are mentally healthy, but that's not always the case. Here are some steps to help overcome depression: 1. Build A Support Network The people that make up your support network can help encourage you to ground you emotionally, help you with problem-solving, and simply listen â€“ something that carries a lot of weight. Many times you'll have to make an effort to reach out to those you need in your support group. This can sometimes be difficult because the symptoms of dealing with depression-like fatigue, feelings of worthlessness, and troublemaking decisions can impair the effort to pick up the phone and reach out. Accept the possibility that you may feel uncomfortable asking for help, especially from those who are close to you. You may experience feelings of embarrassment or shame. Be assured there is nothing to be ashamed of. Instead, it takes a lot of courage to ask for help and build your support network, which is an essential step. Be sure to utilize all types of assistance in your support system, including friends, family, mental health professionals, medical professionals, spiritual leaders like pastors, rabbis, clergy, and any others who can provide you with support with their expertise. 2. Get Enough Sleep  Studies using different methods and populations estimate that 65% to 90% of adult patients with major depression, and about 90% of children with this disorder, experience some kind of sleep problem. Most people with depression have insomnia. Neuroimaging and neurochemistry studies suggest that a good night's sleep helps foster both mental and emotional resilience, while chronic sleep deprivation sets the stage for negative thinking and emotional vulnerability. Getting enough sleep is vital to healthy mental health. And for people with depression, it can be two-fold â€“ depression can cause sleep problems and, subsequently, not having enough sleep can contribute to worsening depression. Here are some steps on how to achieve a better night's sleep:  Stick to a sleep schedule Pay attention to what you eat and drink. Create a restful environment Limit daytime naps Include physical activity in your daily routine Manage worries  3. Try Journaling Expressing yourself through journaling can bring your thoughts and feelings, some that can be deep-rooted, to the surface. It's a great way to really get to know yourself. Be honest with your feelings. A lot of different feelings might arise, and when they do, be gentle and kind with yourself and acknowledge those feelings. Remember that if hurtful or scary feelings come up, that you are in a safe place journaling. Journaling allows you to take some control back by writing down what might be chaotic thoughts and feelings rushing around your mind. It allows you to put things into perspective, shifts your focus from dealing with depression to moving toward healing, and empowers you during a time where you may be experiencing feelings of worthlessness. Journaling also gives you a timetable as to when depressing symptoms worsen. It could be the time of day, your diet, people, places, or events. 4. Create a List of Goals  Goal setting is an important piece on the road to mental health wellness. Setting goals helps develop new, positive, healthy behaviors, helps keep you focused, and helps you sustain momentum in your present and future state. Goals also help align your focus and promote a sense of self-control and self-empowerment. Start with a list of questions to ask yourself, such as:  What motivates me? What interests me? What would I do more of if I could? What do I want? What do I care about, or what did I care about before I felt this way? Where do I want my life to go? What brings me joy? What are my dreams and hopes?  Include both short and long term goals, and begin with smaller, easy to achieve goals, and celebrate upon each time you complete one. Use SMART goals to help keep your goals attainable so you'll keep up with them. SMART is an acronym for goals to be Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-based. 5. Meditate  You Don at Have To Get Over Depression AloneGet Support From A Licensed Therapist Meditation is a mind and body practice that has a long history of use for increasing calmness and physical relaxation, improving psychological balance, coping with illness, and enhancing overall health and well-being. Mind and body practices focus on the interactions among the brain, mind, body, and behavior. Meditation can help you gain better focus, have less anxiety, help you become more creative, give you better memory, and lessen stress â€“ all things which are contradictive to the negative effects of depression. 6. Help Others The reason behind helping others is to take the spotlight off your depression and on to something else. Having a purpose in life, whether it be helping out at a soup kitchen, serving lunch at your kid's elementary school, or volunteering to clean up a section of highway is a wonderful outlet. Similar to journaling in terms of focus, what used to be in the forefront now takes a backstep as helping others takes center stage. Research has found that ""positive activity interventions"" can serve as an effective, low-cost treatment for depression. 7. Be Selfish There is no better time than now to be selfish â€“ in a good way. Maybe you've discovered through self-reflection and journaling that you give, give, give to others, but rarely find time or energy at the end of the day to take care of yourself. Or maybe you've put your life on hold to raise kids; the art degree you always dreamed of getting, the cooking classes you always dreamed of taking, or the yoga classes you planned to take to give yourself physical and mental well-being as well as much deserved time away from being a parent.  Be selfish. It will prove to be beneficial for you and your family. It's difficult to be healthy for others if you aren't healthy yourself, and therefore taking care of yourself is imperative. Deliberately schedule time each day, even for 30 minutes, to have some ""you"" time. Take a long, warm bath, go to the gym, garden, take a walk, read, or do absolutely nothing. This is a time where what you're doing is not to achieve something in the sense of worldly achievements like winning the employee of the year award or PTA parent of the quarter. This is a time to relax, give grace and love to yourself, and heal emotionally. Yes, it's time to be selfish! If you have questions dealing with depression, how to get help for depression, or any other mental health-related topic, the licensed mental health professionals at BetterHelp can help you. The professional therapists at BetterHelp are available 24/7, seven days a week, to answer any questions you have and guide you to a place of better health.

5 Major Depression Symptoms And How To Treat Them,BetterHelp,"Are you feeling sad and down and just can't shake these emotions? Depending on the other signs, having a low mood could be an indicator of having major depressive disorder (MDD). There are several different symptoms of depression â€” including a ""depression attack"" â€” that can make this common mental health issue so severe and potentially impairing. In this article, you will learn about them and also how you can get help and start treatment.  Persistent Low Mood & Irritability  Worried Your Low Mood Is More Than Just A Bad Day?Speak With A Therapist To Work Through It For example, someone who has recently lost a loved one can be distraught and might describe their feelings as being depressed, but they aren't struggling with depression as a health condition. In this case, this person is dealing with bereavement or grief, but not depression. However, it is undoubtedly possible for life events like these to evolve into true depression. [1]The main hallmark symptom of major depressive disorder is a mood that can be characterized as sad, blue, or even hopeless and worthless. However, people can become extremely sad and experience despair, and technically not be depressed in a medical sense. To have a diagnosis for major depressive disorder, all symptoms, especially a low mood, need to have been present for at least two weeks, but depression can often last for years, or a lifetime if left untreated. [1] These negative feelings may also be unprovoked, and a person might have no explanation for why they feel sad or hopeless â€“ they just do, and this can also be indicative that someone has depression.  Loss Of Enjoyment Of Hobbies & Activities  When people are depressed, they often have a lack of desire to do things that they used to like to do. Activities might not sound fun or appealing, or there may be little-to-no motivation to do anything at all. The medical term for lack of pleasure is known as anhedonia, and it's very common in depression and other mental health conditions. There are also two types of it â€“ social anhedonia and physical anhedonia. People with social anhedonia might not have any interest in interacting with others and can turn down offers to spend time with friends and family members. It can also make forming relationships difficult and can potentially damage them as well. Physical anhedonia can involve the lack of joy from activities, but it can also include no longer liking the taste of your favorite foods or not wanting to be touched and no desire for sexual contact. [2]  Appetite & Weight Changes   Conversely, people might resort to food to make themselves feel better, even if it's just temporary relief.As mentioned in the previous section, depression can take the enjoyment out of things, and this can include food. It is very common for individuals to have weak appetites, and consequently, stop eating and lose weight. Typically these foods, which are often referred to as ""comfort foods,"" are high in fats, sugar, and calories, and other substances that make them taste good and cause people to crave them. Research shows that these foods will temporarily stimulate the brain and enhance their mood. [3] Due to the contents of these foods, people who self-medicate their mental health issues with food are also at risk of gaining weight or becoming overweight and obese. In fact, those who are already struggling with weight gain and obesity may notice that they need to consume more food to get the same effect as someone is at a lower or normal weight, which makes these health conditions worse. [3]  Sleep Difficulties & Low Energy  Another symptom of major depressive disorder that is frequently reported by patients is that they have problems with sleeping, and research shows that sleep is heavily connected with a person's mood. Those who don't get enough sleep are more likely to struggle with mental health problems like depression and anxiety. [4] This issue with sleep can go both ways â€“ many people with major depressive disorder struggle with insomnia and have trouble going to sleep at night because their thoughts keep them up. This is especially true for individuals who also have anxiety, which is commonly found paired up with depression. Worried Your Low Mood Is More Than Just A Bad Day?Speak With A Therapist To Work Through It Even with many hours of sleep, these individuals often don't feel rested and experience excessive daytime sleepiness. The fatigue makes it challenging to focus and concentrate on the tasks that they are presented with.However, people who are depressed might also find themselves oversleeping and possibly running late to obligations such as work or going to class. This is known as hypersomnia.  Self-Destructive Behavior & Suicidal Ideation  While all of the other symptoms of depression covered so far can certainly make depression one of the most severely impairing mental health conditions, the topic of self-harm and suicide makes depression also one of the most deadly ones, if it isn't treated. This also goes for other mental health concerns, like bipolar disorder, where a depressive episode can be present and part of the diagnostic criteria. If symptoms are severe enough, and the feelings of hopelessness are unbearable, individuals with depression might find destructive outlets to cope, such as self-harm, which can also include substance abuse. The latter is often used as a way to self-medicate. According to Harvard University, the vast majority of depressed patients do not attempt or commit suicide, but it does greatly increase the risk of it. [5] Therefore, it is still essential that people find help and get treated as soon as possible, and in the next section, that will be discussed. Finding Help For Major Depressive Disorder Millions of people around the world struggle with major depressive disorder, and it's one of the most common mental health issues around the globe, yet, it remains undertreated, despite being highly-treatable. Typically, the primary methods for treating depression are medication and therapy, and people often see faster improvement and better outcomes when utilizing both of them. Medication for major depressive disorder is almost always an antidepressant, such as an SSRI (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor), and it can treat the symptoms of depression that may be caused by a biochemical imbalance in the brain. The neurotransmitter serotonin is especially correlated with depression, and these medications will help modify its levels. SSRIs tend to have fewer side effects than other options, but it can still be a trial-and-error process finding what works for you. [6] Psychotherapy is another method that is highly recommended to those who have depression as well as any other mental health concerns. Sessions can make use of general talk-therapy, or it can also utilize techniques that are more involved and hands-on such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT can change your negative thoughts and behaviors into ones that are more positive and productive, and this can work for different conditions as well, not just major depressive disorder.Always consult with your doctor if you have side effects from the medication, or you don't think the one that you have been prescribed is effective. Don't end the use of it abruptly as this can be dangerous, and always keep in mind that it often takes a few weeks before you see any benefits from antidepressants. For instance, if you tell yourself that you're not good enough and that there's no point in trying, you'll be able to recognize this negative thinking pattern and be able to change it on the spot. Instead, you'll be able to tell yourself that kind of thinking will guarantee that you're setting yourself up for failure and that you should try your best instead. The outcome may be better than you expect. It will take practice, and a skilled therapist who is trained to help those with depression will be able to guide you every step of the way. Online therapy from BetterHelp can connect you to a licensed mental health professional as soon as you're ready to get on the path to treatment. It's affordable and convenient, and most importantly, effective. Additionally, those who are the most successful in fighting major depressive disorder often report that they take medication and work with a therapist and that it makes their sessions more effective and that it gets easier each day. Conclusion Coping with major depression symptoms can be hard to deal with, and although they can last a very long time, they don't need to be permanent. Hopefully, by reading this article and understanding the symptoms of depression, and through reaching out and getting assistance, you can overcome them and be a happier and healthier version of yourself. It will take time and effort on your part, but you're not alone, and depression can be beaten, and good mental health can be achieved. References  American Psychiatric Association. (2017).

Does Alcohol Cause Depression And Can You Fix It?,BetterHelp,"Alcohol has always been used as a way to cope with emotions that people are uncomfortable with. People can enjoy a drink after a stressful day of work to relax, whereas others might deliberately try to self-medicate and numb their pain following the end of a relationship or the death of a loved one. Therefore, it's very common for people to consume alcohol in response to the things that make them feel depressed, but does alcohol cause depression? This article will cover the connection between alcohol and depression as well as discuss ways you or someone you care about can get help. The Effects of Alcohol on The Brain Do You Worry Alcohol Is Contributing To Your Depression?Learn More With A Therapist As mentioned in the introduction, negative emotions can drive people to drink, and this can lead to alcohol abuse if people drink to cope with their feelings. This is especially true for those who are just feeling depressed; rather, they are struggling with a common mental health condition â€“ major depressive disorder (MDD). Major depression affects about 1 in 15 people, but when you add alcohol or substance abuse into the equation, it is estimated that out of those who have depression, 1 in 3 will also have signs of an alcohol use disorder, or alcoholism, according to the American Addiction Centers. [1] It's well established that these conditions can go hand-in-hand, just like how anxiety and depression are often found paired together, and it happens because of how alcohol works in the brain. By its very nature, alcohol is a depressant; even though it can make people feel more energetic and friendly, it also induces relaxation, hence why it's common for people to have a drink or two when winding down and trying to reduce anxiety and de-stress. Alcohol also makes you sleepy, and the more that people consume it, the more sedating it can be, and this is why you've probably heard of people ""blacking out"" after a period of heavy drinking. The consumption of alcohol has a lot of different effects on the brain, and it can  depress certain areas of it. For example, it decreases activity in the prefrontal cortex, which is associated with rational thought and decision-making. [2] This is why many people will have lower inhibitions and make risky choices while under the influence of alcohol. It also slows down your motor activity, and people may have difficulties walking straight, hence why it's a test used by police offers to help determine if someone was drinking and driving. These are just a few examples of what some of the mechanisms are which illustrate how alcohol is a depressant, but does alcohol cause depression, or does alcohol help people cope with the condition with its depressing effects? Is alcohol misuse merely a depression symptom, or do people who start drinking first tend to develop major depression? The next section will discuss these issues further as you continue to read on. Can Alcohol Cause Depression? While we know for sure that depression symptoms can cause people to drink and develop alcohol problems, the issue of whether or not alcohol is not fully understood, and it's still debated. For instance, the American Addiction Centers maintain that depression can arise because of alcoholism and that it's more likely that people will develop depression because of their alcohol consumption, rather than the other way around. [1] However, in this case, the symptoms of depression will go away once the individual ceases to drink. [1] On the other hand, other medical sources state that those who have depression are more than twice as likely to develop a drinking habit. [4] The National Institute on Drug Abuse also mentions that alcohol can make depression symptoms worse and various comorbid conditions are often involved with alcohol or drug misuse. For example, excessive drinking can cause someone to run into financial trouble or lose their family, which can cause depression to spiral out of control, which can then lead to more drinking. Overall, it becomes a vicious cycle. What is for certain here is that either one can be the cause of the condition and vice-versa. Additionally, not all depressed individuals will run into alcohol issues, nor will all alcohol abusers have major depression. What's most important is knowing the risks of both of them, and there is a relationship between alcohol and depression. Here are some questions you can ask your doctor: Is there a relationship between alcohol and depression? How long does alcohol induced depression last? What comes first depression or alcoholism? Do people who use alcohol have mental health issues? Will my mood improve if I stop drinking? Does quitting drinking make you happier? What percentage of alcoholics are depressed? How does alcohol affect mental health? What is alcohol psychosis? What happens when you drink alcohol everyday? Is there any clinical or experimental research about alcohol and mental health that I can read to help myself understand this better? How To Get Help For Alcoholism & Depression  If you struggle with either depression or alcohol problems, or both simultaneously, it is possible to overcome both. However, the latter tends to be more challenging than the former. Additionally, while there are certain aspects of both that can be treated at the same time, and there are correlations between the two, the abuse of alcohol and depression are two separate and complex issues that have certain symptoms that should be targeted separately, such as withdrawal. For example, psychotherapy is highly recommended in the treatment of depression, and it can also help change the way you feel about alcohol by exploring the reasons that compel you to drink; however, alcoholism is something that will most likely require assistance from addiction specialists at a treatment center. Finding an Alcohol Treatment Center Treatment centers exist for all types of addictions that may coexist with depression, and they are also often just referred to as ""rehab."" Drug and alcohol treatment centers can be found in your local area, and recovery will usually consist of multiple steps. Usually, the patient will need to enroll in a treatment center near them where they will be evaluated closely and get information about your addiction and other things such as psychiatric history. Following these assessments, patients will usually be able to begin the intake process, and treatment will either be in-patient or out-patient. However, in-patient treatment is the most common, especially those with severe alcoholism. In-patient treatment at a treatment center is ideal because it will help you detox more safely. You will be able to receive medication that will help you move through the withdrawal stage easier. Being in-patient treatment might not sound too comfortable, but it's designed to make you successfully detox and not fall back on bad habits. However, many treatment centers also have on-staff therapists who can make your time there easier by giving you the skills to cope with everything better, and also prepare you for when it's time to go out on your own again. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is one particular technique that has shown success in treating alcohol use disorder, and many people retain the skills that they learn through it. Once you exit your treatment center, there are still options for you, and it's recommended that you participate in them to prevent relapse and keep you sober. This is sometimes referred to as ""aftercare"" by some rehabilitation facilities, and it's an ongoing process â€“ it may be something that you need to attend and work on indefinitely. One of the most popular places for those who struggle with alcohol problems to find support is through Alcoholics Anonymous or other 12-Step programs where you can meet up with others and talk about your experiences. By being able to share, it makes the process easier for everyone involved, and many former patients who succeed will also be around to provide advice. Finding Therapy For Depression As mentioned earlier, therapy can be useful for treating depression and getting to the bottom of what causes you to want to drink alcohol. Without addressing depression, you may be at risk of drinking again because the primary source of depression hasn't been resolved. You may address some or all of these issues in an in-patient treatment center, still to stay on track, maintain sobriety, and keep making progress, it is ideal to continue therapy once you are out of the facility. Finding a therapist who can help you is just as straight-forward as finding a rehabilitation center for alcohol, and an inquiry on your preferred search engine should yield some results nearby you that you can use. Do You Worry Alcohol Is Contributing To Your Depression?Learn More With A Therapist However, online therapy is an excellent choice as well, and it eliminates the need to travel anywhere, making it an extremely convenient option. It's also discrete, affordable, and importantly, non-judgemental. At BetterHelp, connecting to a licensed professional who can help you fight depression and give you support while you maintain sobriety is simple. Finding a counselor or therapist to help you is just a click away! In addition to alcohol use disorder, one of the best psychotherapy techniques for helping individuals overcome depression is the use of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). CBT can be used on a variety of mental health issues and mental illness because of the core concepts that make it work, which is to change a person's thoughts and beliefs about the problems that make them feel the way they do through conditioning. Essentially, you were conditioned to think and behave before, and you can be reconditioned to feel differently. This can result in long-term, healthy major life changes down the road. Therefore, by understanding how techniques like CBT work, you can be well-equipped to beat depression and alcohol use disorder because you'll learn how to change negative thought patterns and maladaptive behaviors, such as drinking to cope and alcohol cravings, into ones that are more positive and productive. Conclusion If you've been wondering, ""does alcohol cause depression?"", hopefully, this article has answered your question and provided you with other useful information regarding the topics of alcohol and depression. While it's inconclusive that one is more impactful than the other, people are at risk of developing either condition â€“ depression can result in alcohol use disorder, and alcohol can cause depression and maybe a depression symptom itself. Alcohol abuse and substance abuse can lead to events that can cause depression, such as family or financial issues. Both are serious conditions that need to be treated as soon as possible; it will take time and effort, but it is possible to overcome both conditions. References  Watkins, M. (2020, February 3).

Depression In College Students: How Common Is It?,BetterHelp,"While college can be an exciting time full of new experiences, it can also be some of the most formidable years for many students, especially new ones transitioning to it for the very first time, who may feel like they have no friends in college. Stress, anxiety, and depression in college students is an issue, and the latter will be the focus of this article. Here, you will learn about how this condition affects students on campuses all over and what resources are available to help. What Depression In College Looks Like Is The Transition To College Life Causing Challenging Emotions?BetterHelp Can Support You In This Time As mentioned before, college can be a wonderful time, but unfortunately, that is not the case for everyone. Moving away from one as parents (potentially for the first time), having to make new friends and possible connections for career opportunities, and of course, the new workloads and having to prepare for tough exams are things that can make adapting to a new environment very difficult for college students. It's completely normal for college students to feel sad, anxious, or stressed out once in a while, especially when an important project is due, but normally these types of feelings pass after an event is over or within a few days. [1] If it's persistent, it can be indicative of a much bigger issue. If students are unable to cope, all of these responsibilities that college students have can contribute to the development of anxiety and depression, which frequents campuses everywhere. College is also often the time where people experience their first psychiatric problems.[2] College students may struggle with several symptoms of depression, such as [1]:  Emotions like sadness, irritability, guilt, worthlessness, and hopelessness Sleep difficulties, which can involve sleeping too much or too little Low energy, restlessness, and being easily fatigued Appetite changes, which can either be reduced or increased, leading to weight loss or gain, respectively Lack of interest in activities that were previously enjoyed Trouble concentrating in and outside of class Physical pain, such as headaches and muscular aches Substance use and abuse Risky behavior (i.e., reckless driving or unsafe sexual activity) Suicidal ideation, including attempts and self-harm  All of these symptoms of depression can present themselves with very specific problems related to college students. Here are some examples: Steven has been missing class a lot more often because he sleeps through it. He struggles to fall asleep at night because his thoughts keep him awake. Macy is normally a very sociable and proactive student. However, she has been distancing herself from her friends lately, and her grades have been slipping due to not having the energy to study. Tom is involved in college sports, but his thoughts have weakened his appetite, and he doesn't have the strength to perform to his potential during practice and at games. Elle misses her family and friends back home and finds it hard to think about the assignments she has for all of her classes. Benjamin feels like college isn't the right path for him, but he wants to make his parents happy. He currently isn't passing his classes, and feels hopeless about his situation and feels guilty about potentially disappointing his mother and father. As you can see from these examples, depression in schools can lead to academic impairment and hamper a person's ability to study and do their assignments as well as impact their social lives. In addition to their mental health, their physical health can also be negatively affected, especially if a student's eating habits change, and they stop taking care of themselves, in general. [3] Many will even consider dropping out of college entirely because the symptoms of depression are too unbearable for them. Among these possibilities, depression in college students also comes with a risk of suicide, as it does for non-college students with the condition. In the United States, suicide is the second-leading cause of death to those who are aged 10 to 44 years old, but it's been a growing issue among college students who are typically aged around 18 to 30 years old. [4] In the next section, you will read about more statistics regarding depression in college so you can get a better picture of how campuses are affected by this condition. How Many College Students Have Depression?  Before we cover the college depression statistics, it's essential to understand the magnitude depression has on a much wider scale. Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that around 300 million people around the world struggle with depression, and it's a leading cause of disability along with anxiety. [4] Anxiety and depression typically go hand-in-hand as well, as they can have related causes. In the United States, approximately 17.3 million adults aged 18 and older and 3.2 million adolescents aged 12 to 17-years-old had experienced depression that year. [5] However, symptoms of depression can last for years if left untreated, so these values are likely much higher if you consider those who have had depression at least once in their lifetime. Each year around two million high school graduates move onto college, and many of them feel unprepared for many of the new changes that they will face. Things can become overwhelming, and many won't have their old support systems around to help them cope with these challenges when they set foot on campus and become college students. A study carried out in 2019 by the American College Association's National College Health Assessment (NCHA) showed that around 46 percent of college students, within the last twelve months, felt that their symptoms of depression made it difficult to function. Additionally, 72 percent reported feeling very sad but not necessarily impaired. [6] One recent study displayed a significant increase in depression and anxiety as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as students have had to adjust to a new type of college environment characterized by online learning and social distancing. Anxiety, on the other hand, affected around 66.4 percent of the students and felt that it was overwhelming. As mentioned before, anxiety and depression can often coexist, and around 16.6 percent had both. Depression in college can also often be seen with eating disorders as well. There isn't a set figure or estimate available for how many college students are struggling with symptoms of depression right now, but we can make an educated guess based on the info that is provided to us. In 2017, roughly 18 million students were enrolled in college, and according to the American Institute of Stress, around three out of four of these college students experienced overwhelming anxiety at least once during their time there, and just under 30 percent had symptoms of depression within the last two weeks. [7] Although these statistics are for anxiety, we know that anxiety and depression are quite comparable in terms of the number of people they affect. If we use the statistic 46 percent of college students experienced depression in the last twelve months, from earlier, we can deduce that just under 9 million college students have had symptoms of depression during the last year. If you consider depression during college students' whole college career, this value should be even higher. Therefore, these statistics illustrate that depression in college is a significant problem and that steps need to be taken to ensure that young adults have the resources they need to fight it and get back on track to not only improving academic success but their overall well-being. Mental Health Resources For College Students Is The Transition To College Life Causing Challenging Emotions?BetterHelp Can Support You In This Time One of the perks about college campuses across the United States is that there are typically resources available to students that are designed specifically for the treatment of mental health issues that college students face. Your campus may have a counseling center and on-campus doctor or psychiatrist who you can schedule visits with, and this resource is usually covered in your tuition and fees that all of the college students pay each quarter or semester. If by chance, your campus doesn't offer these services, you can also consider outside help from mental health professionals who can also provide treatment like regular talk-therapy or psychotherapy such as cognitive-behavioral therapy. Unlike therapists, psychiatrists can provide prescriptions for antidepressants, which can also be helpful for reducing symptoms of depression. You can also try out online therapy, which is just as effective as in-person sessions when it comes to the management of the symptoms of depression, but with some added benefits. It's affordable and convenient, and you can participate in your home or dorm. At BetterHelp, you can easily find a counselor or therapist who specializes in helping people with anxiety and depression as well as other issues such as eating disorders, OCD, bipolar disorder, and more. Making an appointment is flexible, and you should have no trouble at all finding a therapist that works with your school schedule. Conclusion  Mental health issues such as anxiety and depression aren't going away anytime soon, but there are many things we can do to make things better. In addition to the campus' obligation to support mental health resources, college students can begin by starting to identify the signs of these problems and helping their peers who are in need. It all starts with education and creating awareness, and hopefully, this article sheds some light on how depression in college students or anyone, in general, is something that shouldn't be underestimated and ignored.",2022-08-17,Special Groups
Are There Foods That Help With Depression?,BetterHelp,"You probably have heard of the term ""comfort foods"" at least once in your lifetime; these are usually processed junk foods that tend to be high in calories, bad fats, simple carbs, and sugars that can temporarily uplift your mood. However, despite being effective, at least in the short term, these foods are clearly unhealthy and not recommended. Instead, there are better options out there that you can find that are more nutritious and can help with some of the depression symptoms, and in this article, you will learn about some of the foods that help with depression, so you can start incorporating them into your diet. Healthy Fats Learn How To Manage Depression With The Right Food ChoicesA Therapist Can Help You Get Started Fat has a reputation for being something that should be avoided, but the truth is, there are good fats and bad ones, so a distinction should be made when choosing what to eat. The bad fats you should steer clear of are the saturated and trans-fats whereas the healthy ones you should make sure to have in your diet are known as monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, and these can be found in many different foods such as:  Avocados Nuts and seeds (sunflower, flaxseed, walnuts) Dark chocolate Eggs Seafood (fatty fish like salmon and tuna)  Fish's effects on depression have been researched, and one study shows that those who consumed the most were estimated to be 17 percent less likely to be depressed than others. [1] There has also been considerable interest in Omega-3 fatty acid's benefits on depression and overall health, and it may be worth supplementing with fish or flaxseed oils, especially if fish isn't abundant or too expensive in your area. It is believed that Omega-3s can positively affect the serotonin and dopamine receptors in your brain, which are correlated with your mood. [2] In addition to making us feel better, having fats are important for numerous cellular processes in the body, and it's a mistake to cut them out completely as you need them to live. All you need to do is find the right kinds. Complex Carbohydrates Like fats, carbs are another macronutrient that needs to be carefully picked out in our diet. Many junk foods are loaded with carbohydrates, but not the good kind. It's true, carbs are an important source of energy for the body, but if you are eating foods that are filled with simple, refined carbs and sugars, which are found in countless food items, such as white bread and rice, sodas, desserts, and some kinds of pasta, to name a few, you will probably experience a spike in your blood sugar and insulin levels. You then may notice your mood improve, but it will soon start crashing down and start feeling less energetic throughout the day. Instead,  like fats, you don't need to cut out carbohydrates entirely, but you need to find the good, complex carbs that provide a reliable source of energy because they convert to glucose slower. These good carbs can be found in:  Whole grains (brown and wild rice, quinoa, oatmeal, barley) Fruits (apples, bananas, strawberries, grapefruit) Vegetables (leafy greens, like spinach, and starchy vegetables, such as sweet potatoes) Beans and legumes(kidney beans, black beans, chickpeas)  These types of foods tend to be high in other nutrients needed to be healthy and happy such as fiber, beta carotenoids, and different vitamins, especially vitamin C and the ones in the B-complex. For example, studies show that low levels of folate and vitamin B12 are connected with depression symptoms and that increasing their consumption can improve the response to antidepressants, and therefore, overall treatment outcomes. [3] Many of these foods make excellent snacks as well as sides to any meals, and will a much better alternative to the processed and simple carbs found in sugary foods and drinks that make your energy levels crash and burn and lead to obesity and diabetes. Protein  A protein-rich diet can be quite effective in helping to fight depression in a few different ways. Protein is heavily associated with animal meat, but plant proteins can be just as effective and a great substitute for those who don't want to eat meat. Here are some great options to choose from:  Poultry (the meat found on birds, such as turkey and chicken is leaner than other sources like beef and pork) Seafood Nuts and Seeds Eggs Beans & Legumes  As you might have noticed, many of the foods that help with depression have been discussed already, so you're getting nutrient-rich sources of foods; however, protein works on depression symptoms for slightly different reasons than fats or carbs. Proteins are important building blocks in the body, and they are made up of many different amino acids. These amino acids are important in the brain, and two of them in particular, tyrosine and tryptophan, are essential for the synthesis of the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin, respectively. [4] Turkey meat and chicken breast are excellent sources of these two amino acids. You may have heard of the connection between turkey and tryptophan already, as well. If you celebrate Thanksgiving holiday, there's a chance you've noticed that you get sleepy after eating a turkey meal; this is an effect of tryptophan, and the sleep-promoting benefits can also help your mental health as well. Vitamin D Vitamin D's connection to depression has been researched because it is the only one that can be synthesized through sun exposure. In fact, sunlight can account for 90 percent of a person's vitamin D requirement. [5] The other vitamins must be obtained through the diet. There is a correlation between depression and low sunlight and vitamin D levels, and this can be the reason why depression affects those who get very little sunlight in certain parts of the world. This phenomenon is known as seasonal affective disorder (SAD), or seasonal depression. However, most people in the United States have insufficient levels of vitamin D, and the causes for this aren't always due to nature. Many people's lifestyle factors, such as staying indoors and not participating in outdoor activities, can be to blame for this. [5] Fortunately, although sunlight can be very good for you in moderation and while it is highly recommended, if you can, there are also food sources that can help get you the vitamin D that you need. You can try:  Fatty fish (salmon, tuna, herring, sardines) Dairy products that are fortified with Vitamin D (such as milk and cheese) Egg yolk  If you cannot consume dairy or you don't want to eat any of these animal products, vitamin D is also abundant in supplements, and a multivitamin should be able to do the trick. What Else Helps? Learn How To Manage Depression With The Right Food ChoicesA Therapist Can Help You Get Started What you eat on a daily basis can have a tremendous effect on your health and well-being, and changing your diet to include more whole foods like the ones discussed in this food and depression article can certainly help your mood. You should also try to limit or eliminate your caffeine intake as well as nicotine, alcohol, or other substances in order to see optimal results. However, is this all enough to cure depression? Probably not, and you will most likely need some assistance and need to address your thoughts and feelings that are tied to the condition itself. A mental health professional, such as a counselor or therapist, can help you get to the root of your depression and give you the skills and strategies you need to cope and eventually overcome it. At BetterHelp, you can connect to licensed professionals today and get started on the path to recovery. BetterHelp's online counseling and therapy services are convenient and affordable and can be a valuable asset in your depression treatment, along with modifying your diet. Additionally, medical help can also be useful in treating depression, and many cases of depression are due to biochemical reasons, such as low serotonin levels. Although foods mentioned in this article have properties that promote neurotransmitter production and brain health, an antidepressant that is prescribed by your doctor or psychiatrist may be a more potent treatment method. It is recommended that you take advantage of all of the resources that are available to you as depression is a highly treatable condition, and if you comply with them fully, the vast majority of people will find relief. Conclusion Finding the right diet and eating foods that give you the nutrients that you need is something that shouldn't be underestimated when it comes to treating depression, and hopefully, this guide has given you some useful advice on how to modify your diet. Sure, they may sound good, but resist the temptation to go for the comfort foods that you crave that make you feel good at the moment, but don't do anything for you in the long-term. These can easily be substituted for foods that help with depression, which can make you feel energetic all day long, and live a healthier life overall. References  Oaklander, M. (2015, September 10).

The Top 7 Best Herbs for Depression,BetterHelp,"Depression is something that afflicts almost everyone at some point in their lives as either a mild or severe emotional issue. Because it's so common, it's no surprise that there are so many cultures and medical traditions that have used herbs to treat depression throughout time! While there are many highly effective chemical antidepressants available by prescription today, some people prefer to go a more natural route with treating their depression. If you're looking for an affordable, safe, and effective way to treat mild to moderate depression symptoms, then a herbal treatment protocol may be right for you. Looking For Natural Ways To Heal From Depression?Discuss Options With A Licensed Professional Make sure to speak to a licensed healthcare professional before taking any of these herbs. While most of these herbs are very safe when taken in small quantities to treat depression, it's important to seek advice. This ensures that there aren't any contraindications between the herbs and medications that you may currently be taking.  If you have a particular medical condition or are in a unique medical situation (such as during pregnancy or lactation), you also need to check with your healthcare professional to make sure that these herbs and supplements are safe for you.  St. John's Wort (Hypericumperforatum L.)  St. John's Wort is a relatively well-known herb that has been used for centuries as a successful treatment for depression. In fact, St. John's Wort is currently one of the most commonly used treatments for depression in Germany! It is most often taken in a capsule/pill form or drank as a tea, although other methods such as essential oils or consumption of the fresh herb may also be used. The recommended dosage of St. John's Wort is 450mg two times daily; more or less can be taken depending on the precise situation of the individual taking the herb (for example, if the person is also battling other health issues or is on medication the dosage may need to be altered accordingly). A 2008 study done on St. John's Wort conclusively showed that the herb is at least as effective in managing depression symtoms as most regularly prescribed antidepressants in the United States if not more effective. The study was able to determine that St. John's Wort can successfully treat mild and moderate depression symptoms with fewer side effects than those experienced when taking antidepressant medication. In another trial, St. John's Wort was administered to patients along with folic acid. The combination functioned by modulating serotonin receptors and assisting in the breakdown of serotonin and noradrenalin, successfully treating depressive symptoms. The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health has found some support for the use of St. John's Wort for treating major depressive disorder, but cautions more research is needed. NOTE: St. John's Wort may interact with oral contraception, leading to adverse effects. Those taking birth control pills should consult their consult their doctor before taking St. John's Wort.  Saffron (Crocus sativus L.)  Saffron is an exotic and luxurious spice of the Far East that sports a rich orange-red color and a distinctive flavor. But did you know it can also be used as an antidepressant? In ancient China, this herb was traditionally used as a treatment for not only depression, but also as an antispasmodic, expectorant, and aphrodisiac. While saffron can be more expensive to obtain than some of the other herbal supplements on this list, it elicits a surprisingly effective response against depression without the other undesirable side effects of antidepressant medications. There are three primary bioactive substances in saffron: picrocrocin, safranol, and crocin. These three substances work together to achieve the desired antidepressant activity in the body. Research suggests that crocin and safranol's inhabitation of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin reuptake receptors in the brain is likely responsible for the antidepressant effects that saffron produces in people who are experiencing depression symptoms.    Rhodiola (Rhodiola rosea)  Another study found that taking saffron supplements for eight weeks led to a reduction of depressive symptoms and improved the resilency of study participants against the development of other psychiatric disorders. Because Rhodiola is an adaptogenic herb, it's a fantastic treatment for not only depression but also for other kinds of mood disorders! Rhodiola is particularly well suited to managing and treating depression caused by stress and stressful situations, or that caused by PTSD. Rhodiola is also sometimes called Arctic Root or Golden Root and its main purpose is to help the body fight off stress reactions and to support healthy mood balancing. The herb has been used for generations in northern Europe (where it originates), and it's still extremely popular in Russia as a tea to treat poor attention span, fatigue, and memory issues. For medicinal purposes, Rhodiola is best taken as an extract that contains approximately 2-3% rosavin and 0.8-1% salidroside (both vital constituents in the plant). Experts recommend that individuals with mild to moderate depression start by taking 100mg of the extract one time per day for one week, and then to increase the dosage by 100mg for each week thereafter until 400mg daily is reached. NOTE: Medical experts advise those taking prescription medications for major depression not to take Rhodiola, as taking both can cause a buildup of serotonin levels in the body, leading to serotonin syndrome. It may also trigger manic symptoms in those with bipolar disorder. If you have bipolar disorder or are taking a prescription antidepressant, consult a healthcare professional before taking Rhodiola.  Ashwagandha  Ashwagandha is another adaptogenic herb with a substantial effect on treating mild and moderate cases of depression. This Indian herb, otherwise known as Indian ginseng, has a history dating back over 6000 years and has been used as a part of numerous ayurvedic cures throughout the world as traditional Indian medicine has spread. In modern western medicine, ashwagandha has also been scientifically proven to have great effects on balancing moods, especially when it comes to treating depression. For the treatment of depression, patients are advised to obtain full-spectrum ashwagandha extract for daily use. A dosage of 300mg (in capsule form) taken twice per day is adequate to treat most depression cases. When taken in the proper dosage, most patients taking ashwagandha for depression only notice minimal side effects.  Ginkgo Biloba  Long used in Chinese medicine, in recent decades Ginkgo Biloba has gained popularity around the world as an herbal supplement that can be used to treat not only depression, but also attention problems, anxiety, dizziness, tinnitus, and memory loss (among other issues). Actually, ginkgo Biloba is so effective as herbal medicine that doctors in Germany regularly prescribe it as a medication! The herb is also available as an OTC treatment in Germany and other countries around the world. This herb works to treat depression by increasing the uptake of serotonin and dopamine in the brain, and also by reducing free radicals and blood viscosity. Individuals with mild to moderate depression can take ginkgo Biloba in doses of 40mg three times daily (for a total dose of 120mg). Up to 240mg can be taken each day. Looking For Natural Ways To Heal From Depression?Discuss Options With A Licensed Professional NOTE: If you have a severe allergy to poison ivy, poison oak, or poison sumac you may want to avoid gingko Biloba because its constituents can cause an allergic reaction for people who are allergic to these plants.  Maca Root (Lepidium meyenii)  Maca is a traditional South American plant used among the indigenous people in Peru and the Andes Mountains to boost brain function, as well as treat a variety of health conditions, including (but not limited to) depression, decreased libido, pre-menopausal symptoms, and more. The root is generally consumed as a tea, in capsule form, or as a powder mixed with water or milk. While the plant can be used to treat depression in both men and women of any age, it's most often used to treat anxiety and depression in women who have reached menopause because of its balancing effects on the hormonal systems in the body. In 2008 a study was done for the journal Menopause that analyzed the effects of maca root on depression and other pre- and post-menopausal symptoms in women. The study found that there were dramatic improvements in both mood, libido, and overall energy in all of the 14 women who participated in the study.  Rosemary (Rosmarinus officianalis)  This might be a surprising remedy for depression, but rosemary is actually a very effective in natural remedy for mild to moderate depression and the accompanying symptoms. The plant's primary constituents, rosmanol, circimaritin, and salvigenin all work together to produce both depression-fighting and anxiety-reducing effects. These constituents are thought to work by working with the GABA receptors in the brain. Rosemary is an important healing herb, but it's also a great spice to keep in your kitchen. The plant can be used with most Italian dishes and also in some Middle Eastern foods to ""supplement"" an anti-depression herb or medication protocol. If you want a more concentrated form of the herb, consider buying rosemary in capsule form or as an essential oil (food grade). Lavender   Lavender may be another natural remedy for depression. A small, recent study from 2020 finds that lavender oils can successfully reduce depressive symptoms in healthy individuals. The main Aside from benefitting people with depression lavender oil can also treat anxiety by calming the parasympathetic nervous system. BONUS SUPPLEMENTS: Acids and SAM-e Acids and SAM-e are related supplements that are often taken together to combat depression.  There are two kinds of acids are body needs: amino acids and fatty acids. Although not herbs, amino acids are present in all of the foods that we eat, including herbs, and they're vital for our survival and well-being.  The amino acids L-tyrosine and gamma aminobutyric acid  (GABA) are connected to brain health and mood control. L-tyrosine consumption was shown in animal studies to lead to enhanced cognitive performance and defense against depressive symptoms. Meanwhile a deficiency in GABA is theorized to be a risk factor for major depressive disorder (and other depressive disorders). There's also fatty acids, particularly Omega-3's. Omega-3 fatty acids, which are frequently present in fish and other seafood, are excellent for your body and brain. They have long been well-liked as dietary supplements for their physical health benefits.  Research is more mixed on whether Omega-3 fatty acids are helpful in easing depressive symptoms. Most studies which have looked at Omega-3 fatty acids have done so as part of their use in conjunction with other medications.  Those trials where the dietary supplement was used alone have yielded more limited results, suggesting that they have the most impact in those who are deficient in Omega-3''s. The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health has noted that more research is needed before Omega-3 fatty acids can be recommended as a primary treatment for depressive symptoms. Meanwhile, SAM-e (S-adenosylmethionine) is a supplement that has been proven to relieve the symptoms of not only mild depression, but also of severe depression. SAM-e is essential for the production of certain amino acids (including methionine and cysteine), so taking amino acids and SAM-e together can be particularly effective. What is the Difference Between Complementary and Alternative Medicine? The use of natural remedies and dietary supplements is usually associated with alternative medicine. However, it's not true that all doctors who use natural remedies and dietary supplements in their treatment of mental disorders. Many, instead, are fall under what is known as integrative health, also known as complimentary medicine. Practitioners in complementary and alternative medicine will both use herbal and dietary supplements in their treatment of depressive disorders, but where alternative medicine practitioners eschew the use of mainstream medicines completely, those in integrative health will use dietary supplements and other natural remedies alongside mainstream medication and treatments.  Conclusion Always remember to talk to a doctor before starting to take any herbs or supplements to treat depression symptoms. While most of these herbs and supplements are extremely safe when taken on their own in low doses, it's smart to seek the knowledge and advice of an expert in complementary and integrative health to make sure that you're doing the best thing for your body and mind.  The FDA is yet to endorse the use of herbs and supplements for reducing depressive symptoms. ILikewise, the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health has also noted that more research is needed on these approaches. In addition, a study has implicated a wide variety of natural remedies on this list with the potential to cause manic symptoms in those with bipolar disorder. Some of these herbs have powerful effects, so their use must be carefully monitored to achieve the desired results. Our therapists at BetterHelp are experts in their field and are dedicated to helping people overcome their emotional struggles and live a better life.

There are a variety of natural supplements which can improve depressive symptoms. Some of  the most popular include St. John's Wort, Saffron, Rhodiola, Ashwaganda, Gingko Biloba, Maca Root, Rosemary, and Lavender. While none of these may necessarily cure depression on their own, scientific evidence supports their use in reducing depressive symptoms, especially if taken in conjunction with more traditional antidepressant medication and combined with therapy. Best of all, unlike prescription antidepressants, they can be easily obtained over the counter, making them a welcome source of relief for people with depression who may be waiting to obtain their prescriptions for other drugs. What are the best herbs for anxiety and depression? What herb improves mood? What can I take instead of antidepressants? What vitamin is a natural antidepressant? One of the best dietary supplements for people with depression to take is Vitamin D. A systematic review found that levels of Vitamin D in the body were inversely correlated with clinical depression. However, it did also say more research was needed before recommending universal Vitamin D supplementation for depression treatment. The study authors suggested that people with depression were more likely to benefit from Vitamin D supplementation if they already were deficient in it. What herbs increase serotonin?

The Burns Depression Checklist: Steps Toward Recovery,BetterHelp,"Depression has a confusing list of symptoms that can be brought out by any number of things â€“ loss and grief, significant life changes such as moving to a new city or starting a new job, and even just genetics. Although the word ""depressed"" is often used interchangeably with the word ""sad,"" the two are clinically different, and the mechanisms of each are separate from one another. Nevertheless, many people come to the realization that they may be struggling with mental illness, like depression, after showing symptoms associated with feeling sad, most notably despair, low self-esteem, loss of interest in sex, low or loss of motivation, sleeping too much or too little, loss of interest in previously loved activities, and increased levels of anxiety. If these symptoms have been occurring for an extended period of time (longer than the past week or two, for example), it may be worth looking into them more deeply. The presence of these symptoms often causes alarm for people experiencing the onset of mental illness or their family and loved ones, leading to increased interest in checking symptoms and seeking answers and information. One of the most common resources that come up when searching for depressive symptoms and information on depression is the Burns Depression Checklist. Who Is ""Burns"" in the Burns Depression Checklist? The ""Burns"" in Burns Depression Checklist is David Burns, a psychiatrist who began practicing in 1976. Burns was known in his career for popularizing the use of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, a type of therapy that is usually delivered drug-free to individuals, couples, or family struggling with mental illness; while he was not the inventor of CBT, his consistent use of the practice with his patients garnered increased interest, and his 1980s book (""Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy) brought even greater acclaim and interest in the practice. From there, Burns continued to write books and practice in the mental illness field as an MD, increasing public awareness of the mind and mood, and how important both are in shaping worldview, combating (or prolonging) mental illness, and improving quality of life. David Burns worked and studied under the father of Cognitive Behavior Therapy and employed it in his own practice. Individuals in his field and those who have read his books and received treatment from him have lauded his work.  David Burns was no longer a clinical practitioner treating mental illness but has instead moved on to teaching and researching. He has collected numerous awards throughout his career, including the ""Distinguished Contribution to Psychology through the Media Award,"" honoring his efforts to bring psychological concepts and treatment methods for mental illness to the public through his books (2). Why Is His Work Significant? Cognitive Behavior Therapy May Help You Cope With DepressionLearn How By Speaking With a Therapist The approach Dr. Burns took to working in psychiatry was somewhat new: he focused on drug-free mental illness treatment, honing in on mindset and creating improved mental health through changing thoughts and thought patterns, rather than relying on other popular methods of the day. He is also known for his TEAM approach (Testing, Empathy, Agenda Setting, Methods), which is still used in many therapy offices to this day. While many doctors in the same decades were working closely with patients to improve mental health and improve stress management techniques, Dr. Burns strove to create a system that made the process simpler, streamlined, and more effective, making drug free treatment for mental illness more widely available to both practitioners and patients. The Burns Depression Checklist: An Overview The Burns Depression Checklist is a single-page assessment, designed to be completed by the individual in need of help. The assessment is comprised of 25 questions and a 0-4 rubric, wherein test-takers score themselves on how they can relate to a series of questions or statements such as, ""Feeling unhappy or blue."" Starting at 0 (""Not at all"") and going up to 4 (""Extremely""), people using the Burns checklist can rate their own symptoms and come up with a semi-reliable indicator of the presence or lack of depression symptoms. Uses for the checklist vary. It can be used in some clinical settings to provide clinicians with a reference point from which to begin a drug-free CBT session. It can be used in a community setting to screen a population for symptoms of depression, anxiety, and other mental illness. It can also be used by the average person as a means of detecting mental illness. Far from functioning as a treatment tool, the Burns Depression Checklist is one of the first steps in seeking help, in both home and clinical settings. How To Use The Burns Depression Checklist To use the Burns Depression Checklist, grab the checklist and a pen. This is not a timed assessment, nor should it be treated as a mental illness exam; you cannot answer incorrectly. You can only answer dishonestly. When using the checklist for yourself, please take care to follow these basic guidelines:   Answer honestly. In order to get an accurate idea of whether or not you are experiencing depressive or general symptoms of mental illness, you must answer as honestly as possible. If you are concerned about judgment from others, remember that you can tear up the paper after you are done (if completing the assessment at home), or request that your assessment not be viewed (if you are in a clinical or drug-free therapeutic setting). Answering honestly is pivotal to the efficacy of the assessment. Answer according to ongoing feelings, rather than acute ones. Feeling intense sadness after the loss of a beloved pet or loss of a loved one is normal and does not necessarily indicate the presence of depression. Feeling extreme anger after your trust has been betrayed is also a normal experience and does not necessarily suggest that something is amiss. Constant, unprompted irritability, feelings of despair, or thoughts of self-harm do not fall under the umbrella of ""typical"" and may warrant further investigation into mental illness, beginning with the Burns assessment. Pay attention to even low depression scores. Although it may be tempting to write off your symptoms if your numbers add up to ""mild depression,"" the presence of depression in any capacity is reason enough to seek help, even if it means seeking only a drug-free facility equipped with counselors. Although symptoms of depression are not equal to the presence of ideation, depression is a progressive mental illness and can grow worse if it goes untreated.  Using the Burns Checklist is a simple process. Your answers are only as public as you'd like them to be, and are often used only as a basic assessment, rather than a means of diagnosis or drug-free treatment. The purpose of the assessment is to shed light on how you are feeling, how strong your symptoms are, and possible avenues for treatment. Other Uses For The Checklist The checklist is not only a tool for self-assessment, though that was its initial purpose: it can also be used to assess others. In a drug-free clinical setting, this is usually still somewhat self-directed, as a therapist might deliver the questions, but leave the answering up to the patient in question. The checklist might also be used by a caregiver, family, or concerned partner in search of more information about depression and symptoms their loved one is showing. If depressive symptoms seem significant, they may then present the assessment to the individual they are concerned about. This is not a common use of the assessment, but it can be used as a way to start a conversation about possible mental illness. The checklist may also be brought to your first therapy appointment, as a way to demonstrate to a therapist exactly what it is you are experiencing. Although therapists are trained to ask questions and pay close attention to speech and mannerisms to detect mental illness and direct treatment (such as a drug-free CBT approach), it can be helpful to have a baseline from which to work. Discuss the possibility of bringing and using the assessment when making your first appointment. The assessment may also be used as a helpful reminder of recoveryâ€”or an indication that current treatment needs to shift. If, for instance, the assessment was taken at the start of therapy, and is taken again two months later, with little change, that would suggest current treatment avenues are not working. Conversely, if the answers have been positively impacted after several months of therapy, it can be helpful for both therapist and patient to know that current treatment methods are working. Steps Toward Recovery Although a single assessment cannot cure an ailment, or provide lasting healing, small assessments of your mental health can be useful in determining whether or not there is a likelihood of mental illness present or whether more information is needed. This is an important tool for many individuals to have at their fingertips, as it transfers the power of knowledge and discovery from being solely within the grasp of medical professionals and moves it into the hands of the public at large. Being able to plug in your symptoms and have them quickly and succinctly evaluated can give you some peace of mind in moving forward with drug-free mental health treatment. Cognitive Behavior Therapy May Help You Cope With DepressionLearn How By Speaking With a Therapist Far from being a mental health treatment in and of itself, the Burns Checklist is designed to alert users to the possible onset of mental illnessâ€”and depression, in particular. Being aware can help give users confidence in reaching out for help and can provide mental health professionals with a basic framework to work within, including drug-free CBT. If, after taking the assessment, your score falls on the spectrum of depression, it may be easier to reach out for help, as you may feel that your concerns about your mental health are now more ""legitimate."" It is important to understand that even if the Burns Checklist does not identify you as ""at-risk"" for having depression, or suggests depressive symptoms are not significant enough to warrant taking a second look, you know yourself better than an assessment. If you feel that your mental health is struggling, or that mental illness has begun to descend, do not hesitate to reach out for help. Local therapy offices, counseling centers, and drug-free online therapy, like that offered by BetterHelp, are all wonderful resources to use for depression and depressive symptoms to improve your quality of life. BetterHelp offers individual therapy, family therapy, couples therapy, and even group therapy for a plethora of mental health conditions and concerns, including depression.

Surviving Postpartum Depression,BetterHelp,"Going through pregnancy and childbirth is difficult on its own. Add in the complications of postpartum depression, and raising a brand-new child can be incredibly trying. As you may know, the difficulties do not end as soon as you have your child. For many mothers and fathers, postpartum depression is a very real and persistent part of parenthood. Whether you've just had your first baby or your fourth, postpartum depression can affect you. With the challenges life presents with a small child, it can be hard to feel confident in managing postpartum depression. It's entirely possible, however, and the following information and tips will tell you how. Symptoms Of Postpartum Depression Believe You are Experiencing Postpartum Depression?Connecting With a Therapist Can Help You might already know that postpartum depression is a mental health issue that can occur after having a baby. Many people refer to it as the ""baby blues"" â€“ a term describing the common sadness that affects parents of new babies. Pregnancy and childbirth is such a life-altering experience that mental health can become a concern in the aftermath. Identifying the symptoms of postpartum depression is the first step in healing. Lack Of Interest In Activities Many new parents are uninterested in the things they once were. Although a lot of these are simply things that new moms and dads just don't have the time for, there is a difference in an inability to participate in activities due to the time constraints â€” and a complete lack of interest in activities that were once enjoyed. For example, perhaps before the baby, mom and dad loved spending time with college friends at a night club on the weekends. After they have a baby, they likely no longer have the desire nor energy to go out every Friday night. This doesn't necessarily mean that either of them has postpartum depression â€” they are simply new parents. Instead, this particular postpartum depression symptom is something different. Enjoyable activities and hobbies no longer capture the attention of a parent with postpartum depression. This might mean sex, reading, or even watching sporting events. This symptom is often accompanied by others when you have the baby blues. Gauging a new mother or father's mental health requires the analysis of all symptoms of postpartum depression. If a parent is experiencing a lack of interest in beloved hobbies and activities, a counselor or doctor can help them to determine if this is a symptom of postpartum depression. Change In Diet An additional symptom that may occur because of postpartum depression is a change in diet. Although many mothers eat more while breastfeeding, and either parent may even sometimes forget to eat as much, big diet changes can be an indicator that postpartum depression is present. If you notice that you are eating a lot more or much less than you did previously, postpartum depression may be a concern for your mental health. What is considered a big enough change in your diet to be regarded as a postpartum depression symptom? For many people, a big diet change results in a noticeable weight fluctuation. Although a mother's body weight may start shifting due to breastfeeding, a new lifestyle, or simply because you just had a child, weight gain or loss that is fast might indicate a drastic diet change. Tracking your intake can help to determine how you are eating now compared to before the baby. Anxiety And Fear In Parenthood Becoming a parent to a little one can cause anxiety and fears that you never imagined. While some of these feelings are completely expected, postpartum depression can bring feelings of fear that are severe and/or consistent. Fears that come with postpartum depression often include the overall feeling of being a bad parent, consistent thoughts about the safety or health of your child, or being afraid to be alone with your baby. Many parents experience panic attacks and find their fears to be so excessive that they cannot sleep. Insomnia, Inability To Stay Asleep, Or Sleep Problems In General  Beyond remaining awake due to fear, mothers or fathers with postpartum depression often experience a general inability to sleep or stay asleep. Of course, frequently when babies don't sleep, parents don't sleep. This particular symptom is for those who are unable to sleep even when the baby is sleeping. It can be dangerous to live with little to no sleep, so new parents experiencing this symptom should reach out for assistance from a counselor or medical professional as soon as they are able. Contemplating Self-Harm  Although postpartum depression does not always reach this level, if you're experiencing thoughts of harming yourself or your child, help should be sought out immediately. In order to get past postpartum depression, those living with it often require counseling, medication, or various other methods of treatment. Seeking help for this condition is often imperative. (If you or a loved one are experiencing suicidal thoughts, reach out for help immediately. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline can be reached at 1-800-273-8255, and is available 24/7.) How To Manage Postpartum Depression Once you have identified your symptoms, finding help is necessary for moving forward. Counseling can often be arranged via your OB or family doctor. There are also a number of online resources, such as BetterHelp, that can provide access to counselors and mental health professionals trained in the best ways to assist those in need. Postpartum depression isn't an issue that should be left alone â€” getting help as soon as possible can prevent symptoms from getting worse. What's Involved In Postpartum Depression Counseling? Some people living with postpartum depression are hesitant to try psychotherapies or counseling because they imagine it to be highly uncomfortable. Spilling all of your thoughts to a stranger while sitting on a stiff armchair in an unfamiliar office can be intimidating to think about. However, many people feel that getting things off of their chest is freeing. Additionally, a therapist doesn't simply listen. While listening to patients is a major component of therapy, counselors and therapists are also there to help find solutions. What solutions might a therapist be looking for in counseling? Teaching patients with postpartum depression how to relax, how their thoughts might be inaccurate, how to change their thoughts into something positive, or how to best manage anxiety are common techniques in counseling. By finding the right counseling style for you or your loved one, symptoms of postpartum depression can be decreased, and healing can be made a priority. What Does Medication Do For Postpartum Depression? Believe You are Experiencing Postpartum Depression?Connecting With a Therapist Can Help Some parents with postpartum depression are prescribed antidepressants in an effort to balance out naturally occurring chemicals in the brain. Many people wish to avoid medication due to unpleasant side effects. But avoiding side effects often simply requires trying a few different medications (based on your doctor's recommendation) to find the best option for you. Postpartum depression can be scary if it goes untreated or if medication is stopped suddenly. If you begin taking an antidepressant, it is important that you continue medication until your healthcare provider makes a change. (Before beginning any medication, it's crucial to discuss your options with your doctor to avoid any negative side effects.) Other Ways To Manage Postpartum Depression In addition to counseling and medicating, many new parents have found that there are a variety of other ways to improve mental health. Postpartum depression can hit suddenly or over time, so it is important to take an active role in attempting to manage it. Studies show that natural sunlight, regular exercise, and self-care are great ways to cope with depression in a positive manner. It may be particularly helpful to practice these activities if you have a heightened risk of developing postpartum depression. Risk factors include a personal or family history of depression, financial hardship, relationship issues, stresses, such as a loss of a job or ill family member, multiple births, or an especially difficult experience with breastfeeding. If you do have one or more of these factors, consider how natural remedies might help your depression. Postpartum depression may not be easily solved with these remedies, but there is a chance that a walk in the sunlight can do you some good. Getting out and reminding yourself of the existence of life outside your home is necessary for a lot of new parents. Although you have another new life to care for, you must first take care of yourself. Moving Past Postpartum Depression When you're in the midst of postpartum depression, you might wonder how you'll ever find a way out. The knowledge that there is a way to make it through can be helpful. Using the tools and modern medicine available to you is the best way to get past postpartum depression. Dwelling on it and avoiding help will only serve to make it harder to manage.  Conclusion If you are feeling as though you might have postpartum depression, there is no harm in seeking help before things get worse. Communicating with a counselor does not automatically mean that you have a mental illness like postpartum depression, nor does it mean that you have to continue on with sessions beyond the first one. Simply giving counseling a try might help you to determine if postpartum depression is a concern for you. You can then determine if counseling is best for you and your situation. Whether you choose counseling, medication, or another route to improving your mental health, postpartum depression can become a thing of the past for you with professional help. Do not hesitate to reach out for that help if you feel as though you may be struggling with this illness. With treatment, you may find that postpartum depression was a hurdle you had to jump in order to be a great parent. Allowing your mind to heal and taking care of yourself is the best way to then care for your brand-new child. Set a goal for healing and take positive steps toward achieving it!",2022-08-23,Coping strategies
From A Medical Perspective: Is Depression A Mental Illness?,BetterHelp,"How often is sadness expressed as depression?  Often people use the term depression to describe normal human sadness.  For many people, depression and sadness are simply used as synonyms;  not a measure of mental health. While it may be true that a symptom of depression is sadness, being sad does not necessarily mean that an individual is depressed. In fact, from a medical perspective, depression is an actual mental illness. Medical professionals refer to depression as a major depressive disorder. This term refers to severe feelings that interfere with everyday life and living. What is Mental Illness? Living A Happy Life After A Depression Diagnosis Is PossibleA Professional Can Help You Understand How Source: rawpixel.com  The simplest definition of mental illness is a sickness of the mind. Most commonly, mental illnesses are those that alter moods, the way people behave, and/or how they think. Mental health issues such as these are often depressive disorders or a bipolar disorder, in addition to a number of other possibilities. Since mental health concerns and illnesses are those that change a person's mind, it is fair to assume that depression is a mental illness. Getting a deeper understanding of depression can help explain how this disorder is in fact a medical mental illness, rather than simply being sad. What is Depression? At its root, depression is a mood disorder that affects an individual's mental health. In the most common cases of depression, people experience a sense of sadness and lack of interest in life or activities. Mood disorder has the ability to completely change a person and the way that they live life. If you or someone you know is suffering from depression, you may notice that you no longer behave or think in the same manner that you once did. You may also find that physical illness and health concerns accompany depression. Depression can affect anyone, but typically the specific types of the disorder latch on to a certain demographic. Types of Depression There are several types of depression that can be experienced. From postpartum to psychotic,  depression can capture the mind of all kinds of people in various states of mental health. Although each type of depression has a list of symptoms, specific feelings, and demographic qualities, understanding the medical background of these disorders is imperative in proving depression as a mental illness. Postpartum Depression  Source: pexels.com  What is it about postpartum depression that marks it as a mental illness? A case of postpartum depression makes it hard for new moms to take care of themselves and their babies. This mental health concern occurs when postpartum depression puts so much pressure on the mother's mind that she is unable to fully focus on keeping herself and her child healthy and safe. As most mothers understand, caring for your child is your utmost desire. To feel unable to do so does more than suggest that depression is a mental illness. Bipolar Depression Bipolar disorder is a mental illness that causes an individual to swing from extremely happy to extremely sad quickly and often without warning. In order for a brain to go from one end of the spectrum to the other, mental illness seems apparent. It is one mental health disorder that is associated with depression, but also with other forms of mental illness. Psychotic Depression When it comes to psychotic depression, individuals experience delusions in addition to their low moods. These delusions often stick to the same ideas, such as believing they are terminally ill when that is not the case. The mind tricks the sufferer into various untrue and serious beliefs, leaving their mental health in a state of concern. Persistent Depressive Disorder When someone experiences a sense of depression for two years or more, they may have a persistent depressive disorder. Although he or she may have moments of less severe depression throughout those two years, the steady presence of extreme lows indicates this type. This is a mental illness that is especially hard on the individual for a long period of time and severe for overall mental health. Symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder The symptoms of depression include various feelings, thoughts, and outward appearances. Although physical aspects of depression are typically the result of other symptoms, there are some things to look for when seeking indicators. Identifying depression and seeking assistance starts with knowing what symptoms to look for. Only then can you begin to improve your mental health. Some of the most common symptoms that might occur when you have a major depressive disorder include, but are not limited to:  Feelings of prolonged sadness Extreme changes in sleep patterns Diet changes Overall lack of interest in things previously enjoyed Loss of sex drive Irritable Pessimistic Inability to concentrate Thoughts of self-harm or suicide  Experiencing one or more of the above-listed symptoms may mean that your mental health is not at its best. Given that each of the symptoms for depression can have a major effect on an individual and his or her life, it is safe to assume that it truly is a mental illness. How Do People Get Depressed? Are people born with an increased chance to get depressed? Do life circumstances lead them to depression? Is it random? Each of these is a valid question when it comes to depression. The truth is, there are a number of reasons and situations in which depression might be more prominent in some people. It is also true that some people see or experience things that alter their mental health and state in such a way that depression can take over the mind. Living A Happy Life After A Depression Diagnosis Is PossibleA Professional Can Help You Understand How Source: rawpixel.com  Traumatic events in one's life can lead to depression over time and alter mental health in a negative light. This is especially for those that experienced such things in childhood. Abuse, abandonment, and loss are common childhood traumas that change the brain and make an effect well into adulthood. Trauma can also be experienced in adulthood and be the onset of depression or other mental illnesses. Abusing drugs and alcohol is another way depression can make its way into someone's life. Sadly, alcohol serves to worsen depression, so the abuse of the substance will never allow for healing. Alcohol and drug abuse are never good for one's mental health. Injury or illness can also contribute to the start of the depression. This is often because of the individual's circumstances, the inability to go out, or the feeling of constant pain. Many times, depression begins to heal when the injury or illness has improved, but that is not always the case. Monitoring your mental health in the case of injury or illness may be as important as keeping track of other components. Family medical history seems to play a role in whether an individual is susceptible to depression. Studies have shown that depression can become a genetic trait for family members' mental health status. If a family member suffers from depression, you may be likely to suffer the same. Sometimes this is when another cause has occurred, and genetics leave the mind to respond with depression. No matter the cause, there are treatment options available for those suffering from depression. There is no reason to continue suffering alone in a mental health crisis. Discovering the best treatment option for you begins with knowing what is available to you. Treatment Options for Depression Perhaps the most recommended form of treatment for depression is counseling. You may opt to go to a physical office, or you might even choose to do counseling online, both of which can be of great help. Talking out the thoughts that fill your mind and hearing how a counselor might reorganize or restructure those thoughts can help you to see the truth. Remember, just because your mind tells you so doesn't make it true. Learning how to determine what's real and what's in your mind is a skill that counselors can teach you for the betterment of your mental health.  Source: rawpixel.com  Another option for treatment is medication. Although some people put forth their efforts in therapy prior to trying a medication, others prefer to try the medication first. It is imperative that you speak with your doctor about the best treatment options for you and your mental health. Since medications often come with side effects, it is important that you weigh the pros and cons of taking a medication. Some people believe that acupuncture and meditation are alternate forms of working through depression and various mental health concerns. There are also other forms of therapy and an exercise regimen that might assist in healing your mind. No matter which form of treatment you ultimately decide to go with, learning how to move past depression is something that can be done. Getting the help you need is what is most important. Accepting Depression as a Mental Illness Although it may be a taboo topic, it is safe to say that depression is truly a mental illness. Medicine has identified it as such. With the symptoms that cut into all areas of a person's life, the toll it takes on their mind, and the physical harm that can occur as a result, seeing depression as anything but mental illness is dangerous. Mental health is important to all people and the treatment of mental illnesses needs to be a priority for everyone. As a mental illness, depression can alter the mind in ways that are hard to understand. If you have experienced depression or know someone that has, you can see how life changes. Accepting the truth about this illness is necessary for the future of treatment. The days of turning a blind eye to depression are gone â€“ with that individuals can receive treatment for their mental illness without shame or jumping through hoops. Mental health is an important component of health, in general, and should be treated as such. Other Commonly Asked Questions Is depression defined as a mental illness?

Depression Meaning: Is It The Same For Everyone?,BetterHelp,"It's a common word in the mental health world and in general: depression. With how much it's used in everyday conversation, it might make you wonder if it means the same thing for everyone. While depression might have one dictionary definition, the way it is used daily gives it a broader meaning. The same kind of word usage is used with bipolar disorder. With the addition of various kinds of depressive disorders that are filed under the depression name, likely, the meaning of depression is not the same for everyone. Identifying the specifics of an individual's personal mental health journey might help professionals to determine the best route for treatment, be it counseling, medication, or other forms of therapy. Medical Dictionary Definition Of Depression Depression Can Look Different From Person To PersonBetterHelp Can Help To Understand The Signs According to Merriam-Webster, depression is defined as ""a mood disorder marked especially by sadness, inactivity, difficulty in thinking and concentration, a significant increase or decrease in appetite and time spent sleeping, feelings of dejection and hopelessness, and sometimes suicidal tendencies."" To say that an individual with depression feels every single mental health symptom as defined would be untrue. People that experience depression often does so differently. Where one individual feels unable to do anything but sleep, someone else might have insomnia. The particular type of disorder each individual has might lend some weight to the possible symptoms of depression. However, even in specified cases, such as postpartum depression or bipolar disorder, people can have varied symptoms. The mental health of each person can be affected differently by the symptoms they have, as well. Identifying specific depression types and the demographics they are most commonly found in might help to show how depression differs for everyone's mental health. Depression In Women It's important to note that depression affects people regardless of gender. By making an effort to understand these types of depression and mental health in general, you will better grasp the idea that depression differs from person to person. The meaning of depression is not the same for all people â€“ it varies by type, including bipolar disorder or major depression, symptoms of depression, and experiences. Postpartum Depression  One form of depression is postpartum depression. This mental health concern is one that occurs in pregnancy and after childbirth. As a mother with a brand-new baby, you might feel overwhelmed, stressed, and missing out on a lot of sleep. While these are all normal feelings for experiencing life with a newborn, some symptoms push the boundaries of what's considered normal. There are glaringly obvious symptoms of PPD (postpartum depression) like self-harm, suicidal thoughts, or even thoughts of hurting your child. Less apparent symptoms of depression might include eating and sleeping differently than usual, feeling moody, frequent crying, or lacking a connection with the baby. Many of these symptoms can be explained away with the presence of a new baby â€“ if the baby doesn't sleep, Mom doesn't sleep. Taking care of a whole new person makes Mom forget to eat. The lack of sleep brings forth moodiness and crying. These aren't always a red flag to look at a mom's mental health. While these symptoms of depression might be explained away, it is still important to talk to a mental health professional or your O.B. if any of these are present. It is always better to ensure that your mind is safe from depression before it has the chance to worsen. The same is true for PMDD. It is also possible for fathers to develop postpartum depression, for similar reasons that mothers get it (e.g., a lack of sleep, being overwhelmed and stressed, and the complex emotions that being a new parent brings). PMDD As A Mental Health Condition PMDD, or premenstrual dysphoric disorder, is a type of depression that exists in 5% of women of childbearing age. This specific kind of depression is explained as an extreme form of PMS. PMDD is the result of changing hormones after a woman's ovulation. The change can result in women feeling tense, having panic attacks, a lower sense of energy, binge eating, long-lasting irritability, and even suicidal thoughts. Although a standard case of PMS would account for some binge eating and irritability, women with PMDD experience the depression symptoms to the extreme. They see significant changes to their own mental health. Depression In Men Depression Can Look Different From Person To PersonBetterHelp Can Help To Understand The Signs While there are not necessarily any depression disorders specific to men, a lot of men experience depression differently than their female counterparts. Statistically, and scientifically, men tend to talk about their problems less than women. They also typically express sadness as aggression or anger. Because of this, the symptoms of depression for men are often different from those that a woman might feel. If a man were to have bipolar disorder and a female were to also have bipolar disorder, they would likely have completely different definitions of the mental health experience. For men, symptoms of depression might include anger, problems with their sex performance or a lack of interest in sex, trouble with remembering details, taking part in risky activities, failing to accomplish their responsibilities within a family or work environment, and abusing drugs or alcohol. While some women might experience the same depression symptoms, statistics show that these particular warning signs are far more common in men. Mental health concerns come across differently in symptoms and how they heal. Treatment in men is another topic altogether. Mental health is not typically something men like to share or talk about. This leads to men avoiding treatment options and making an attempt to get through it alone. There is a stigma about mental health, but this is especially true when it comes to men. Men can have depression, bipolar disorder, or significant depressive illnesses like anyone else. How they react to it, the symptoms of depression they experience, and the treatment (if any) is what differs from that of others that have the same disorders. Depression In Children No one likes to think that their child might have mental health issues or childhood depression. It can be a hard thing to accept â€“ or to even look into â€“ but the truth is that without treatment, your child will likely only get worse. If a parent has experienced mental health issues, their child is more likely to do the same. If a close family member has depression or bipolar disorder, the child is also more likely to have those conditions. For kids, symptoms of depression and other mental health concerns are commonly more physical. Where adults feel sad or irritable, kids sensibly experience their pains. They might also remove themselves from social situations, run away from home, or make comments about their lack of self-worth. It can be challenging to identify these things in a child, but bringing it to his or her pediatrician's attention is typically the first step. Childhood depression is a tough topic, but getting your child help as soon as possible is crucial. Children typically are treated with CBT or Cognitive Behavior Therapy or mental health medications. While medications are not usually the first solution to the problem, antidepressants have been known to decrease suicide rates, especially in kids. Although prescriptions are at times the last resort, it's hard to deny that successful antidepressants have shown those with mental health concerns. Depression In Minority Groups And First Responders Minority groups tend to experience depression far more than the other part of the population. For example, Hispanic people, LGBTQ+ individuals, and first responders are among some of the highest demographics to have depression. What is it about these particular groups that increase the rate of mental health issues? Being in the minority can add stress to an individual's life. For Hispanic people that live in the USA, they may not speak the language and may also be far from any family. LGBTQ+ individuals may feel the pressure to adhere to society's sense of ""normal"" and can feel alone in the world as they learn who they are. These pressures alone can cause depression to set in. When risk factors come into play, the mental health concerns in these groups can be seen more clearly. First responders experience trauma as a part of their job. Police, fire, and EMS are on the front lines helping those in need on some of the worst days of their lives. With such experiences, PTSD, depression, and anxiety tend to set in. In fact, first responders are 20% more likely to commit suicide than the general population. Because of the background involved in how these individuals developed depression, their mental health experience is often unlike anyone else. Treatment Options For Depression: Is It The Same For Everyone?  Treatment options for mental health concerns and depression vary in type, reason, location, and even on a case-by-case basis. In truth, treatment is different for everyone. One person's depression is different from the next person's â€“ treating each case similarly would likely result in poor mental health care. For example, a child suffering from depression would not benefit from online counseling. This is especially true if the child was too young to communicate what's on their mind. Instead, a child might do better with play therapy. A paramedic suffering from PTSD and depression might find success with a group of other first responders that have seen similar things. Mothers with postpartum depression might feel most comfortable with online counseling, as they can reach out to a counselor while the baby is awake late at night. No matter how an individual seeks help, the important thing is that advice is sought. Depression can get better â€“ as long as the necessary assistance is there. Below are commonly asked questions on this topic: What is meant by persistent depressive disorder?Can you have permanent depression?Is persistent depressive disorder worse than major depression?Who has persistent depressive disorder?How long is too long to be depressed?What does dysthymia look like?What is the most serious form of depression?What causes lifetime depression?Is long term depression curable?Does depression cause brain damage?

Christians And Depression: How To Keep Faith During Hard Times,BetterHelp,"Christian depression, like depression for anyone else, can be a mental health struggle that might begin or worsen during challenging times in someone's life. Although life contains ups and downs, learning how to keep the faith and remember God's love is a skill that can help you to push through the most challenging parts of life's challenges. Research has shown that faith and hope outside of ourselves can be a supportive factor in wellness and can help a depressed Christian. This doesn't mean that a Christian's life will be more comfortable than the life of a non-Christian or that a Christian won't face mental health challenges and possibly need professional help. It indicates that as someone of faith fights to keep their faith in God intact that they might also seek the help of a licensed professional counselor as a resource to help treat depression and better manage their feelings and overcome their pain.  Mental Health Can Impact Even The Most Faithful PeopleAn Online Therapist Can Offer Discrete Help  How does one keep a hold of their faith and God's promises during hard times when you experience depression? Below are some things that may be supportive of your faith in Jesus Christ and helpful in keeping it available to you as a resource while you tackle life's challenges like clinical depression or other mental illness. Bible Studies: Spend Time In The Word To Improve Mental Health A lot of Christians spend time every day in their Bible. Whether it's for a few minutes or a few hours, time spent reading the Bible is one way to keep your faith. It's not magic, however. You can't merely crack open the Bible and expect all your problems to be suddenly answered or your mental illness go away. When you take the time to do Bible studies, your mind's thoughts are placed elsewhere: on the teachings within the Bible, on the inspirational stories about Jesus and King David, and all the uplifting guidance that it contains. Consider how depression might make it as though you worship your mind. You might spend every second of the day in your head, putting weight to thoughts that might not be true, putting yourself down, and feeling shame about it. Although this is entirely normal, it isn't always the best place to get your facts. Rather than putting hope and faith in what your mind is telling you, turn to your Bible readings and discover what things there may be helpful in your present situation. You might even seek out a Christian counselor or other Jesus Christ followers who have overcome mental illnesses to work through studies and apply them to your situation and world. Whether you do a Bible study with a group, alone, or in a counseling session, the most important component is that you are spending time in His truth and applying the word of God to your life. Allowing that truth to take over your emotions and thoughts, filling your mind is essential to maintaining your hope and faith in God and overcoming your mental illness. It can also provide you with a sense of spiritual growth and trust in the Lord that carries you through any challenges that you and your family may be facing. Don't let mental health issues and depression take that power away from you! Keeping your faith in God is possible in times of trouble. Keeping Faith When You've Lost Interest As A Result of Mental Illness People suffering a mental illness like depression or another lifelong struggle can cause individuals to lose interest in the things they once loved, such as time with family members, the desire for heaven, and their belief in God. You may have enjoyed spending time reading the Bible with your family members. Then you started dealing with depression and anxiety. Now, however, this mental struggle with depression might have made it so that you don't feel like you can crack open your Bible or pray. Perhaps it has made you too tired to even try, or it's difficult to concentrate â€“ this is a common side effect with mental health issues. Or you have started feeling isolated from your family members and other Christians. When depression affects you and your mental health like this, keeping faith in God and maintaining hope requires just a little effort and possibly some support from others. Although reading and studying require effort, several activities are far more straightforward that will keep you connected to Jesus Christ and can simultaneously improve your mental health. Attempting one or more methods may help you to hold on to your faith in God and make it feel as though your psychological problems are not too big to handle. Music To Help Mental Health When reading is too hard or carrying on a conversation with God feels impossible, music makes things a bit simpler. For many experiencing mental illness or feeling depressed, listening to a contemporary Christian music station gives them that bit of necessary light. Others turn to Southern Gospel tracks to reconnect with God. Even if the actual words are too much to handle, if you listen to an instrumental version of your favorite Christian song, it can remind you of your faith in the Lord and the feelings of love, inspiration, and inclusion you experience from it in this world. Some songs might even lead you down a path of spiritual growth, improved mental health, a sense of self-love, and a renewal of your soul. Christian Podcast As A Mental Illness Guide  In the technology era that we live in, podcasts are a dime a dozen, and some of them are award-winning for their insightful help. Although you may not have the energy to get up on Sunday morning and attend a church service, there is a wide variety of Christian podcasts to choose from. For many Christians, merely listening to the words of a fellow believer can help to ease your state of depression and may even feel as though there is something to hold on to that renews your hope and eases your challenge. Prayer As A Mental Health Cleanse Depression and mental health, in general, is all about what's going on in our heads. While it is always a good idea to seek out help from a licensed professional counselor when your depressed mental health gets to a low point, talking to God is a great way to deal with what's on your mind and overcome the troubles of this world. It helps to speak to someone, and while God doesn't necessarily talk back to you in words, praying allows your mind to untangle itself. If you are unable to communicate what's on your mind with a professional, remembering to pray and share with God reinforces that you are not alone in this world. Mental Illness Help: Journaling Or Drawing Feelings  If you have the energy, it can be great to journal your prayers or unconfessed sin. When it comes to mental health, it can be a great reminder to see how far you've come and how God has acted in your life. By journaling what you are going through and how you've talked to Him about it, you can go back and see how things improved from what they once were. This activity is a great way to see the path of your spiritual growth and how your mental health may have improved with it. Writing can also be cathartic and is an excellent way to learn about what you're feeling and get over thinking that it's wrong to have hope. In fact, the American Psychological Association even promotes doodling as a form of emotional release. Drawing your emotions can be effective for both children and adults, so choosing this outlet is excellent for all family members. Finding A Bridge Between Faith And Mental Health Ultimately, finding Christian counselors, a family member, or a method that can help you with feeling depressed can bridge the low point and renew your faith and hope, letting you come out stronger in your belief in God. Your faith in God's love and Jesus can have so many connections, as many individuals have communicated how their belief system keeps them afloat. When times are hard for a depressed person, focusing on your faith in Christ will help to keep you strong. Helping Faith And Mental Illness Meet The connection between the two should always help, not harm. A Christian therapist is someone trained in this, as they are eager to help in a faith-based manner. They can also help you rule out a physical illness or other medical conditions as a factor in what you're going through. They might address your feelings or weak faith with the reminder that you are loved by God in a way that helps your mind accept this truth. Mental illness has a way of making people believe things that are not true. When you have a method to remain rooted in Christ that focuses on helping you to get better and stop feeling depressed, you will likely find that depression can be beaten, your mental health can be good, and you faith in God can be renewed. Find A Mental Health Professional Or Friend That Listens Well Another imperative quality is that he or she listens. While therapists and counselors do this, friends, family members, and fellow church members might also be people to turn to with your emotions. Although you might be hesitant to use a Christian counselor to communicate your deepest thoughts, it is essential to remember that they are there for your mental health first and foremost. They are not there to judge you, to say you are a bad Christian for feeling this way, or point out your most significant flaws. A good counselor will listen first and foremost and completely understand your life struggle. Mental Health And Strong Faith Ties Seeking someone or something that is intentionally faith-centered can also be important in improving your mental health and supporting your faith in God. Although any counselor might help you with your mental health, and all counselors are trained and ethically responsible for being supportive of your beliefs, you may feel more comfortable speaking with a counselor who you know is a Christian and shares your specific beliefs. Aiming To Improve Mental Health And Keep The Faith Mental Health Can Impact Even The Most Faithful PeopleAn Online Therapist Can Offer Discrete Help By aspiring to find these qualities in a mental health professional or a method in which you hold on to your faith and trust God, you may find that spiritual growth is occurring amid your depression and anxiety. For a person who is a Christian, depression can be easier to overcome with God's care. The realization of spiritual growth in hard times is a great way to pull through those times. It can be a great way to improve your mental health if you remain rooted in His love. You may think it's easier said than done to improve your mental health with faith in God. Perhaps your own mental condition prevents you from making attempts at Bible readings, studies, or prayer. If that's the case, starting with one of the easier methods might help you to get stronger. With that, you can add another component to your growing faith and perhaps feel your mental health grow stronger as well. Mental illness is a challenge that many must face; maintaining a hold on your Christian faith will serve to make that challenge a bit more guided. Another option is to seek professional help from an online therapist who also shares your love of Jesus and who can work with you and pray with you.     ",2022-07-08,Special Groups
Divorce & Depression: Coping Skills To Make It Through,Nicole Beasley ," It is no secret that divorce and depression often go hand in hand. If you are struggling with the emotional loss and grief of divorce, it can take a toll on your mental health, and may lead to depression. Female and male depression after divorce is very common, even among those who ended the relationship willingly. This difficult time of adjustment won at last forever. Here is what you need to know about divorce and depression and how to make it through to the other side. Are You Experiencing Depression After Your Divorce?Reach Out To A Therapist For Support   Depression after divorce is not the same as clinical depression or major depressive disorder. They are related because it is a situational or an adjustment period. This is usually called situational depression or adjustment disorder. Although post-divorce depression is not clinical depression, it still has many of the same features. It can be difficult to distinguish whether symptoms are part of clinical or situational depression. If you have never had depression before, your doctor will likely treat it as an adjustment disorder. Only if symptoms do not improve over time would they consider a clinical depression diagnosis. Divorce Depression Symptoms The symptoms of depression after divorce are very similar to symptoms of clinical depression. The characteristics of situational depression include:  Lack of appetite Loss of interest in activities and hobbies Difficulty sleeping/Insomnia (conversely, sleeping too much is also possible) Irritability Fatigue Spells of uncontrollable crying Problems concentrating or focusing Feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, and pessimism Suicidal thoughts or attempts  If you or someone you know is experiencing suicidal thoughts, help is available. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline can be reached at 1-800-273-8255 and is available 24/7, or you can text the word ""HOME"" to 741741 to reach the Crisis Text Line. In addition to these classic symptoms of depression, divorced individuals with adjustment disorder or depression are also likely to exhibit certain behaviors. These may include ignoring responsibilities, avoiding social engagements, a drop-off in work performance, or fighting. Post-divorce, it is also normal to have feelings of guilt, anger, and frustration towards yourself or towards your former partner. Nonetheless, it is important to set healthy boundaries with your ex-spouse, no matter the circumstances of your married life. However, dealing with these emotions may aggravate the feeling of depression and cause you to withdraw from others. If you notice that you have begun to completely cut yourself off from everyone around you and stay indoors most of the time for a few weeks, it could be a sign that you are experiencing depression. If it has become difficult for you to cope with the stress of the divorce process and it has greatly affected the quality of your daily life, it may be time to seek professional help.  Divorce Depression Treatment Treatment for situational depression is much the same as that for clinical depression, with one important difference. With clinical depression, medication is generally a must and is combined with therapy to help control the bouts of depression that can occur while on medication. On the other hand, situational depression such as post-divorce depression, puts more importance on psychotherapy or talk therapy and uses medication to control symptoms only when they are severe or prolonged. Psychotherapy There are many types of psychotherapy that are used to treat situational depression. The most common form of therapy used for this type of depression is cognitive-behavioral therapy. Your therapist works with you to identify problems with your thinking to help you control your thoughts and behavior in a conscious way.  Your therapist will also be there to support you at the start of your healing process and help you take steps towards adjustment.   Medications There are two types of medications for situational depression. The first group consists of selective serotonin uptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. These include common antidepressants such as Zoloft and Celexa. The other type contains dopamine reuptake blockers, such as Wellbutrin. Your doctor will likely only prescribe antidepressants if your symptoms are severe, if you are at risk of suicide, or if your symptoms are prolonged. You and your doctor will carefully monitor your symptoms so that medication can be decreased after the adjustment period is over. If you or someone you know is experiencing suicidal thoughts, help is available. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline can be reached at 1-800-273-8255 and is available 24/7, or you can text the word ""HOME"" to 741741 to reach the Crisis Text Line. It is important to note that you should never stop taking antidepressants without first talking to your doctor. Even if you are feeling better or no longer feeling depressed and don at feel they are necessary, wait for instructions from your doctor before stopping the medication. SSRI withdrawal can be very burdensome and even painful. It is paramount that when it is time to stop the medication, it is done so gradually. Coping With Depression After Divorce While being treated by a doctor or therapist, or when you are supporting your efforts during treatment, it is a good idea to learn some coping skills to help you through this difficult time. It is important that you take time for yourself, and that you make sure all your needs are being met. Here are some things you can do to change your lifestyle or build new habits to help you cope with depression after divorce. Write A Journal Journaling can be an important part of your coping toolbox. You are going to have a lot of thoughts and feelings about your marriage, your divorce, and life going forward. As you go through this process, it is a good idea to write down your thoughts and emotions in a journal. Even if you have a good support system, like family or divorce support groups, sometimes you need to be able to let it all out without a filter. A journal allows you to do that. Are You Experiencing Depression After Your Divorce?Reach Out To A Therapist For Support Another advantage of journaling is that you can see how far you ave come. The person you were in your marriage will not be the person you are after you adjust to your divorce. It is a meaningful journey to rediscover your sense of self. When you reach the end, you all be able to look back and see just how far you ave come. During those times when everything seems hopeless, you can go back and see what you have accomplished in personal growth and get yourself back on track. Take Care Of Your Body Research has found that at least 30 minutes of exercise each day can relieve the symptoms of depression. When you are feeling sad, you can go for a walk, lift some weights, do aerobics, enroll in a sports class, dance around the house, or even walk around the mall. Peer reviewed studies have found that regular exercise, regardless of intensity, has protective effects against depression. The important thing is that you get up and moving for at least a half-hour every single day. Doing so on a regular basis can give you this sense of accomplishment and thus help boost your mood. It is also important that you eat as healthy as possible. When depressed, it is common to crave ""comfort foods,"" most of which are high in fat and sugar. Eating these types of foods will drag you down and ultimately make your depression symptoms worse. You could also gain weight, further impacting your mood. Try to limit alcohol use and keep healthy snacks around. If you must go out of your way to eat comfort food, you will be less likely to indulge in it. About three quarters of people with depression have symptoms of insomnia, mostly women. Women tend to have more problems with initiating sleep as a response to stress. It is important to address sleep difficulties as they can be a contributing factor in worsening depression. Lifestyle approaches such as relaxation techniques done prior to bedtime and sticking to a sleep schedule are recommended by the American Psychiatric Association. Herbs such as chamomile tea, and dietary supplements however, have not been shown to be effective for insomnia.  Making efforts to improve your sleep hygiene can improve both your mental health and your overall well-being. Take Time For You In all the hustle and bustle of life and adjustment, it is easy to forget to take care of yourself. Make sure that you are taking some time out for yourself every day. Even if it is as simple as reading in a bubble bath for an hour, you should be doing something to pamper yourself daily. When the feeling of sadness hits you, try massage therapy or other relaxation techniques such as meditation and aroma therapy. This may seem difficult at first, especially if you have children to care for, but it will help keep you sane as you go through this adjustment period and throughout the divorce process. Ask For Help Don at be afraid to ask for help. You will feel more tired and fatigued during this time. Let people help you with pre-made meals, extra babysitting, or household chores. When you are feeling better, you can always return the favor. Traumatic life events like divorce can easily send you into a downward spiral if you are not too careful. It is important to be surrounded by people who can take care of you and can understand your feelings to avoid unhealthy coping such as rebound relationships or binge drinking. You should have a support network around you that allows you to get the help you need when you need it. Get Out Of The House While psychotherapy helps you develop more effective ways of coping with your life going through divorce, treatment for the clinically depressed takes a multifaceted approach. Recent articles put emphasis on a solid support network, usually from friends and family or from social support groups such as divorce support groups. When you are depressed, the last thing you want to do is socialize. It is important that you continue to get out and see people during this time. It will seem like a daunting task at first but spending time with family members or scheduling a trip with your children can be a relevant experience for you towards your healing journey. Getting out of the house and around other people will help take your mind off what you are going through and give you a mental break. You may also enjoy a mood boost with socialization because of that sense of belonging it provides. Don at just surround yourself with those who will lend an ear to listen when you need it.

Depression And Sex: How Depression Affects Your Sex Life,Nicole Beasley ,"Depression can affect many aspects of your life. One of the primary ways that depression affects you is in your relationships. Depression also affects your sex life, which can also affect your relationship in a negative way. Here as what you need to know about depression and sex and how they relate to one another.  Ways That Depression Affects Sex  Depression can affect sex in several ways, according to the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships. While depression itself can often result in a loss of sexual desire, there are several other ways that it can affect your sex life. Medications can also decrease libido, but it is important not to let these side effects keep you from treatment. Here are the primary ways that depression affects sex and desire.  Sexual Self-Esteem Depression can make you feel as though you are not good enough for anyone, including your partner. When you are afraid that you will not be satisfied during sexual relations, it can make you feel as though you want to avoid the experience entirely. When you do have sex, having low sexual self-esteem can make you less likely to enjoy the experience or help your partner achieve satisfaction. Your mind tends to focus on questions about your proficiency instead of being ""In the moment"". Your partner may be able to help you in this if you communicate well together and your partner can reassure you of your ability to satisfy them in this way.  Feeling Sexually Distant Often depression makes you feel emotional and even physically cut off from those you love. The same is true of personal relationships where sex is involved. If you are feeling cut off from your partner, you may be feeling sexually distant. This means that you may not be able to feel as though you and your partner are on the same page sexually. It can also mean that your mind is so absorbed in depression that you are unable to feel sexual desire for your partner, or any other feelings other than sadness or feeling overwhelmed.  Problems Communicating About Sex Communication is key in any relationship, and you must communicate with your partner about your sex life and sexual health. Depression can often make you feel anxious about communicating with your partner. Your depression will convince you that your partner will never understand what you are going through or what your needs are. You must overcome this anxiety to talk to your partner about how you are feeling about sex so that you can work together to overcome it.  Unsure Of Initiating Sex Depression can also make you less likely to initiate sex. Again, your depression lies. It may tell you that your partner doesn at want anything to do with you sexually. Your mind may be afraid to initiate sex because you don at want to overstep boundaries or face potential rejection. Again, communication can be key. Learning to read your partner as signals and allowing that communication to supersede your feelings of fear of rejection or embarrassment is important for overcoming this problem. Depression Doesn at Have To Hold You Back From A Great Sex LifeTalk To A Therapist About Your Symptoms  Decreased Sex Drive One of the biggest side effects of depression is a decreased sex drive. In fact, many people learn that they have clinical depression because they seek help for their lowered sex drive that is affecting their relationship. Certain antidepressants and other depression treatments can also have a side effect of decreased libido or sexual dysfunction. You must discuss these problems with your partner so that they know your lack of interest in sex has nothing to do with them. This can go a long way toward preserving your relationship while you are working to correct the problem.  How To Save Your Sex Life If you have made it this far into this article, you may have realized that you can relate to one or more of the ways that depression and sex affect one another. Recognizing that there is a problem is the first step to finding a solution. There is no one size fits all solution to sexual dysfunction or disinterest during a battle with depression. But some tried, and true methods can help you regain your sexual health and improve your relationships, according to  Web MD.  Treat Depression First Before you can focus on improving your sex life, you need to treat the depression first. Make sure that you are getting treatment in the form of both medication and psychotherapy. Treating depression can sometimes lead to changes in sexual function, but these changes are not necessarily always bad. You may simply need to change the way you think about sex and initiate sex with your partner. You can learn more about how to do this during your psychotherapy sessions, but your primary focus should be on treating the depression itself. Depression can hurt your relationships in ways unrelated to sex. Treating depression is of the utmost importance.   Tell Your Concerns To Your Doctor If you feel that the antidepressants and other medications you are taking to treat your depression are affecting your sex life, talk to your doctor about these issues. Talking about sex to a virtual stranger can be very difficult, but the result can be very rewarding. Often sexual problems are linked to the dosage of antidepressants. Sometimes just lowering the dose slightly can make a huge difference in your libido and interest in sex. You must continue to take your medications, however, and if your doctor feels that your symptoms will worsen with a lowered dose, you may need to find other solutions.  Psychotherapy People who have suffered from depression for a long period have developed habits relating to how they think about themselves, depression, sex, and other aspects of their life. Breaking these habits is just as important as treating the depression itself. Although clinical depression is the result of a chemical imbalance in the brain, the habits that are formed because of the depression cannot be broken with medication and other depression treatments. Only psychotherapy will be able to help you break these habits and stop these trains of thought that are hurting your sex life and relationships.  Communication Communication is key to the success of any relationship. Many people find it difficult to talk about sex, even to their partner for many years. However, talking to your partner about your thoughts, feelings, and insecurities is important. Your depression will tell you that your partner doesn at want to hear about your concerns, but you have to ignore these thoughts and push forward. Only through effective communication can you and your partner get back to some sense of normalcy in the bedroom. You need to communicate with your partner about your thoughts and feelings, but also your desires and what you need to correct the problems you are having on the sexual front. Depression Doesn at Have To Hold You Back From A Great Sex LifeTalk To A Therapist About Your Symptoms  Your Next Steps The first thing to do to improve your sex life is to treat your depression, which starts with an accurate diagnosis and finding resources for psychiatrists and therapists. There are many ways that you might be able to get the help you need, including getting referrals from your primary care doctor or your insurance company. You will also need psychotherapy to treat your depression and your sexual dysfunction or disinterest. Getting the help you need can seem daunting. You have to be able to find the time to go to therapy sessions, as well as to visit a psychiatrist and get the prescriptions you need to correct the chemical imbalance in the brain that is causing the depression. You also have to be able to afford the treatments, which can be expensive even with health insurance. There are some easy ways to get started in treating your depression and sex symptoms, however. One of the best ways to start getting help is through  BetterHelp. BetterHelp is an affordable option for getting treatment for depression and having someone to talk to about your sexual problems. It is also very accessible and convenient. You can contact a therapist by phone, text, or online, with chat, voice, and video chat options. BetterHelp therapists are available day and night, every day of the week so that you can get the help you need when it is convenient for you. You can engage in treatment sessions from anywhere, including your home, your car, or even the restroom or a conference room at work. If you are suffering from depression and sex-related issues that seem to be connected, you should not put off trying to get treatment. Your relationship will continue to be negatively impacted by a lack of sexual pleasure and desire as well as the depression itself. Don at put your relationships at risk. Contact a therapist today to get started on treating your depression and sex problems so that you and your partner can get back to enjoying each other once more.    ",2022-07-08,Education
9 Depression Criteria Used For Diagnosis,Nicole Beasley ,"Clinical depression, also known as major depressive disorder, affects over 16 million adults in the United States each year. There is, however, a distinct difference between sadness and clinical depression. Depression must be diagnosed and treated by a professional such as a psychologist or psychiatrist. There are several criteria that are required for the diagnosis of depression. These criteria are measured either through depression scales or simply through observation and examination by your doctor. Your doctor may ask you a series of questions about your symptoms and lifestyle to determine if a diagnosis of depression is right for you. The depression criteria used are published in the  DSM-5, which is the manual used for the diagnosis of mental health conditions by all professionals. Here are the depression criteria that are used for diagnosis and how they are determined. If You are Living With Depression, You Don at Have To Do It AloneMake A Treatment Plan With A Therapist  Depression Criteria The following depression criteria are determined by the DSM-5 and are assessed by a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist. For a diagnosis of depression, at least five of these symptoms must be present for a specified period.  Depressed Mood Having a depressed mood most of the day nearly every day is one of the primary depression criteria in the DSM-5. A depressed mood is defined as explained or unexplained sadness that negatively impacts your life and your ability to perform day to day tasks. A depressed mood can affect your relationships, home life, and career.  Diminished Interest People who have clinical depression have diminished interest in all or almost all activities of the day. You may have less interest in sex, hobbies, career, school, children, and other aspects of your life. Often people who have less interest in activities or take no pleasure from activities find themselves cut off from others and spend quite a bit of time alone and stagnant.  Weight Changes Depression can cause significant changes in weight. You may experience unexplained weight loss without dieting or changing your exercise routine or activity level. On the other hand, some people eat more when they are depressed, causing significant gains in weight. While weight changes can be a symptom of many mental or physical health problems, when combined with other depression criteria, it can be a clear sign of depression.   Slowing Down When you are depressed, you may mentally and physically slow down considerably. Your mind may not work as fast as it used to, and you may have difficulty completing cognitive tasks. You may also have feelings of restlessness. However, for this depression criteria to be met, the restlessness and slowing down must be visible to others, not just internal feelings.  Fatigue Depression is tiring. Many people who are clinically depressed sleep excessively. If they are unable to sleep, they tend to be very tired and drag throughout the day. Chronic fatigue and constantly feeling as though you need to sleep can be a clear-cut sign of depression.  Feelings Of Worthlessness And Guilt One of the depression criteria is feelings of worthlessness and guilt. You may feel as though you cannot do anything right, or that everyone is better off without you around. You may also frequently feel guilty for things that may or may not be within your control. Unexplained or unreasonable feelings of worthlessness and guilt can make depression worse, and it is one sign that depression has reached a severity that needs to be clinically treated.  Inability To Concentrate Many people who have clinical depression cannot concentrate or make decisions. This is because the mind obsesses over the feelings and thoughts caused by and surrounding depression. When the mind races with thoughts of worthlessness, guilt, inadequacy, and anxiety, it can make it impossible to concentrate on cognitive tasks. Memory can also fail. If You are Living With Depression, You Don at Have To Do It AloneMake A Treatment Plan With A Therapist  Frequency And Duration For a diagnosis of depression to be made, at least five of the above eight depression criteria must be present every day or most days of a period of at least two weeks or more. Most people who are diagnosed with depression have experienced these depression criteria for much longer than two weeks, especially if they have waited to seek treatment.  Associated Features The DSM-5 also allows for associated features of depression. Although these are not necessarily criteria, these features are frequently found in the process of diagnosis of depression. The first of these is a high mortality rate. Patients who are diagnosed with or undergoing treatment for depression must be watched carefully by professionals, caregivers, spouses, and parents for warning signs of suicide. Other associated features are essentially symptoms that many people with depression exhibit. Although these are not depression criteria for diagnosis, these associated symptoms can be an indicator of depression or the severity of depression. These symptoms include irritability, brooding, obsessive rumination, anxiety, phobias, and excessive worry over health.  New Specifiers The DSM-5 has some new specifiers that help continue to narrow down the diagnosis. These specifiers are additional diagnoses that further describe the patient as condition. The first of these is ""with mixed features,"" which simply means that the clinical depression episode has some features of mania, but not enough features of mania to constitute a diagnosis of bipolar or mania. The second of these specifiers is ""with anxious distress,"" and refers to people who have clinical depression accompanied by severe anxiety. Severe anxiety and phobias can make treatment of depression more difficult, and these features need to be considered when developing a treatment plan, especially psychotherapy approaches.  Getting A Diagnosis These depression criteria are used by clinicians, psychologists, and psychiatrists to determine if someone has clinical depression. Many different depression scales can be used to determine if the depression criteria are being met for an accurate diagnosis. The most common depression scale that is used for this purpose is the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. The HDRS can also be used to determine the severity of depression. According to a publication with the  National Institute of Health, many doctors fail to use these depression scales. However, when they are used, they have a clear indication of the severity of depression. This is important for both diagnosis and developing a treatment plan. The depression scales are also important for measuring the success of treatment and the severity of symptoms over time.  Your Next Steps If you are reading this and are recognizing the depression criteria in your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, you must seek help as quickly as possible. Leaving depression undiagnosed and untreated can greatly negatively impact your life in several ways. Relationships, your career, and your family can all get affected. Also, untreated depression can lead to additional mental and physical health problems. Your first step is to talk to a professional that will be able to examine depression criteria and give you an accurate diagnosis. From there, you can get resources for treatment, both with medications and psychotherapy. Some people opt for therapy alone because they do not want to take medications. While this does work for some people, it is important not to rule out medication as a treatment option entirely.  You can go about this in several ways. Your primary care doctor may be able to administer the depression scale and determine if you need to see a psychologist or psychiatrist for further diagnosis or treatment. If you are certain that you need help, you can contact your health insurance company to determine what professionals are covered in your area under your plan. If you do not have health insurance, or you have other barriers to getting help, there are some other options. Online counseling can be very effective for the diagnosis and treatment of depression, and it is much more accessible for many people. The cost of online counseling is much lower than the cost of therapy and treatment at a brick and mortar clinic or doctor. It can also be more convenient and easier to work around your busy schedule.  BetterHelp is one of the services that offer online counseling. You can connect with a licensed therapist on BetterHelp as platform so that you can get an accurate diagnosis of depression using the depression criteria. BetterHelp therapists are available all hours of the day and night, seven days a week, sometimes even on holidays. You can have your therapy sessions through BetterHelp anywhere that you have a smartphone, tablet, or laptop and an internet connection. You have the options of voice chat, video chat, or text chat, either by phone or the online platform. With so much convenience and accessibility, there is no reason to put off getting an accurate diagnosis and starting treatment.",2022-09-01,Education
4 Ways Depression Groups Help You Recover,Nicole Beasley ,"Depression can be debilitating. It can cause you to cut yourself off from friends and family, and society in general. When battling depression, you must follow your treatment plan and get as much support as possible. One of the options you have for support and therapy in your fight against depression is depression groups. There Are Several Options For Support to Overcome Depression Learn More Here - Speak With A Licensed Therapist According to the  National Alliance on Mental Illness, one of the best things you can do to combat depression is to seek out emotional support from others who also experience depression. Often, we turn to friends and family when we need support. But friends and family who are not familiar with depression may spend more time offering advice and less time listening to what you have to say. Also, they may simply be unable to relate to what you are going through. Depression groups are a great solution to get the support you need, especially if you are worried about being a burden on those closest to you. There are two main types of depression groups: support groups and group therapy. Both have their advantages and benefits. Depression groups of all types have a lot of the same benefits and advantages to people battling depression. There are also depression groups for people who are supporting someone else that has depression. Here as what you need to know about depression groups and how they can help you recover.  How Depression Groups Work Depression groups work differently depending on what type of group you are involved in. Most depression support groups are not led by a professional. Instead, they are simply a group of individuals who have battled or are battling depression. It is a safe place for you to discuss your thoughts and feelings, and to hear stories from others that may be able to benefit you and help you feel that you are not alone. Some depression groups are run by a professional. These groups may be more like group therapy, where you will gain some special insight and coping skills while also getting support and making connections such as in a traditional support group. Depression support groups are usually free and offered throughout the community or in someone as home. Depression groups led by a psychotherapist usually have a cost, although they are often covered by health insurance. Here are some commonly asked questions about the topic: How do I find support groups in my area? There are a number of ways to find support groups in your area. To find support groups for mood disorders such as depression and bipolar disorder, you might ask a medical professional for a recommendation to a support group in your area, search the web, or use a support group finder tool such as those on the depression bipolar support alliance (DBSA) support group finder. Locate the DBSA support groups finder here: https://www.dbsalliance.org/support/chapters-and-support-groups/. Another place you might look is the ADAA website. The ADAA is an international nonprofit organization dedicated to preventing and helping those who live with anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and co-occurring conditions (e.g., substance use disorders*). You can use their website to look for a support group here: https://adaa.org/find-help/support/support-groups. *If you or someone you know lives with or shows signs of substance misuse or a substance use disorder, contact the substance abuse and mental health services administration hotline at 1-800-662-HELP (4357).  Some support groups meet in person, but others may use online meeting tools (e.g., video chat platforms). If you have a preference between in person or online meetings, this is something to consider. Websites such as the DBSA website provide additional resources, such as information about conditions like depression and Bipolar disorder. In fact, the DBSA offers information on how to give support to someone who lives with a mood disorder like depression or bipolar disorder. Note that there are support groups for family members and other loved ones such as friends and romantic partners that may be beneficial if you have a loved one who lives with a mental health condition. Is depression considered a mental illness? Depression is a mental illness, also called a mental health condition or disorder. It is one of the leading causes of disability, but the good news is that help is available. If you live with depression or think that you might have a depressive disorder, such as persistent depressive disorder, major depressive disorder, or PMDD, reach out to a medical or mental health professional - such as a primary care provider (PCP) or psychiatrist - who can help. A medical or mental health professional will be able to provide individualized advice diagnosis or treatment, as well as referrals to other medical or mental healthcare providers, if applicable.   How To Make Depression Groups Work For You According to advice from  Psycom, there are some specific things you need to do to make depression groups work for you. First, you should try multiple groups. The first group you go to may not give the vibe or support that makes you comfortable. If you are uncomfortable, you will not benefit greatly from the depression group. Don at give up if the first group or two that you go to doesn at work out. Instead, go to multiple groups until you find the one that works for you. It is also important that you do not worry about your participation. While sharing your thoughts, feelings, and stories with others, you can often gain important insights and help others who may be struggling similarly. Yet participation is far from mandatory. Your first several sessions you may be content to sit and listen simply, and that as okay. You should also be aware of confidentiality. You will be hearing very personal information and stories from the other people in your support group. You mustn at share these details with others outside of the support group. If you hear something that helps you and you want to share it with friends or family, be sure to leave out identifying details. Finally, you should ask lots of questions! No question is too silly, and all questions will be answered by someone within the group. If your depression groups are led by professional therapists, they will be able to answer any question you may have. If your depression groups are not led by a professional, you will still likely be able to get an answer from someone else in the group who has experienced something similar.  Top 4 Ways Depression Groups Help There are many ways that depression groups can help you cope and learn more about depression. Here are the top five most common ways that depression groups can help you recover and maintain your mental health.  Motivation Experts say that depression groups help keep patients motivated to follow their treatment plan. When you are questioning whether your treatment plan is helping you, talking to other people who have met the same roadblocks can be very helpful. If your treatment plan doesn at seem to be working for you, learning about the treatment plans and experiences of others may give you some ideas to bring up with your mental healthcare professional. Depression groups can also give you the motivation you need to keep going. When everything seems hopeless, and you want just to give up, hearing about the stories of others when they hit that wall can be very beneficial. When those same individuals share how they have overcome, or what has worked for them, it can motivate you to keep going in your battle and not give in to the depression. There Are Several Options For Support to Overcome Depression Learn More Here - Speak With A Licensed Therapist  Inspiration Often depression can make you feel as though you are incapable of being successful in life. Depression groups are great for inspiring you to follow through with the things you want to do in life. When you feel as though you are unable to complete tasks or meet your goals, hearing from other people about their success can inspire you to keep going and take on goals that you may have put on the back burner due to your depression. Inspiration can be found in other ways, as well. You may find that you are given inspiration and ideas of how to cope with your depression on your own at home and work. You may also get ideas of how to treat your depression in therapy or with medications that you can bring up to your doctors for discussion to see if they are right for you.  Education Often depression groups contain a wide range of people in different stages of recovery from depression. People who have battled depression their entire lives often lead these support groups. Their experience can greatly benefit you. You may be able to learn a lot about depression and how to successfully cope with it. For example, if you don at know whether to tell your employer about your depression, you may be able to get important information and resources about employment law and depression from others in the support group. You can also learn a lot about depression itself, how it relates to others, and how it can be treated. You may learn healthy coping skills, treatment options, and other information that you were unaware of. While everyone with depression needs to seek professional treatment, you spend limited time with your therapist or psychiatrist. Attending a helpful support group can add to the time you spend in getting support with depression.  Understanding Often when battling depression, it can feel as though no one around you understands what you are going through. When you feel misunderstood, it can make you feel more cut off and make depression symptoms worse. Having someone that understands your illness and what you are going through can be a great help in battling depression.  Getting Started with Help Your first step to getting help with your depression is to speak to a professional. You will want to make sure that you are coping with depression and not some other mood disorder that has similar symptoms. Professionals will also be able to prepare you for the experience of depression groups. They will also be able to give you resources to locate depression groups near you. Your first step is to contact a therapist for treatment.

"An Overview Of Depression: Definition, Psychology & Treatments",Gabrielle Seunagal ,"The National Institute of Mental Health explains that depression is a serious mood disorder which impacts the way a person feels and how well they are able to function in society. Individuals who experience depression regularly take hits to their self-esteem, quality of life, and how they are capable of managing themselves. Depression is very different from sadness, and it as not something that someone can simply shake off or get over. A professional diagnosis of clinical depression, which is called Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), generally follows once someone ongoingly experiences multiple symptoms of depression for at least two weeks or longer. Depression Can Be Difficult To Navigate On Your Own Depression Can Be Difficult To Navigate On Your OwnClick Here To Match With A Counselor You Can Trust  A Closer Look At Depression According to the American Psychiatric Association, depression affects an estimated one in 15 adults in any given year and on average affects young adults. The experience of depression varies from person to person. Not everyone will experience depression in the precise manner of someone else, and that as to be expected. Each human being is unique with their circumstances, body chemistry, and other factors which impact their experiences. Sometimes, depression can vary in degrees, although the longer it lasts, the worse it tends to get. This is because depression creates a pit where people feel like they are trapped and unable to get out. Symptoms Of Depression Presently, there are a variety of symptoms which are associated with the existence of depression. These symptoms have emotional, mental, and even physical impacts. Knowing the symptoms of depression matters and is something which all people should be aware of. If someone suddenly begins acting in ways which conflict with their normal personality, this could be a sign of depression. Emotional and physical problems can arise and can potentially escalate, disrupting family life.  So many lives and relationships have been lost because the people around a depressed individual were unable to recognize what they were going through. Symptoms of depression may occur at either end of the clinical spectrum of mental illness. They range from mild to severe and can include low mood or a depressed mood. Aside from feeling depressed, some common signs of major depression include feelings of emptiness, loss of interest in normally enjoyed activities, restlessness, and withdrawal from others. Many people who find themselves battling depression may also struggle with concentration, have low self-esteem, and even experience suicidal thoughts or worse, suicide attempts. Symptoms of depression are not limited to emotional symptoms but can also take the form of physical symptoms. Notable symptoms include fatigue, changes in sleeping patterns, poor appetite, fluctuations in weight (weight gain or weight loss), chronic pain, and even physical illness. Depression often comes with a physical illness, but it usually precedes the first. Medically ill patients who have pre-existing health conditions, such as heart disease in older adults, have a markedly reduced quality of life. Again, the specific symptoms and degrees can vary, but if someone is habitually evidencing multiple depressive symptoms, this could be a clear indicator. If you or someone you know is experiencing suicidal thoughts, help is available. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline can be reached at 1-800-273-8255 and is available 24/7, or you can text the word ""HOME"" to 741741 to reach the Crisis Text Line. If needed, call 911 or your local emergency number. Causes Of Depression In this day and age, there are multiple risk factors which are linked to the development of depression. Falling into one or even more than one of the upcoming criteria does not automatically mean that a person will undergo a major depressive episode or depression. However, the likelihood increases. Each is different and has a tolerance threshold. Nevertheless, understanding the causes of major depressive disorder can make a significant difference when it comes to prevention measures and clinical treatment after the fact. Individuals who have family history of depression may be more vulnerable to this mood disorder. Scientists are largely investigating more details into the reason why this link exists, but as of now, it is well-documented as a cause of major depression. Of course, not everyone with relatives who have struggled with depression will share this struggle. Still, recognizing genetics as a potential cause makes a difference, especially if someone falls into other risk factor categories.  The quality of a person as lifestyle is another common cause of depression. Someone who is constantly under stress, pressure, and exposed to environments which are not good for them may develop depression over time. This is why being extremely conscious and vigilant of what as happening in our lives is so very impactful. Getting swept up is so easy, but at the end of the day, each person as mental health and wellness should always come first, even if that means letting go of other things. Traumatic experiences which a person goes through yet does not properly deal with can also cause depression in certain cases. This is a prime example where depression serves as a symptom of a greater problem which lurks beneath the surface. The fact that unresolved trauma can trigger depression in human beings is a prime example of why people need to address issues as they arise. This may not be initially easy or comfortable, but in the long run, it always pays off. Finally, clinical illnesses and even certain medicines such as psychoactive drugs, can alter an individual as brain chemistry and engender depression. Recreational drug use has been linked to depressive disorders; however studies are limited regarding this. Again, this is another risk factor which varies according to the individual as brain chemistry and potential other circumstances. If you or someone you know begins to experience signs and symptoms of depression as a result of a health issue or after certain medication, contacting a health professional immediately is critical. Related Conditions The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th Edition, commonly called as the DSM- V, is the most up-to-date criteria for diagnosing mental disorders. Depending on the signs and symptoms the patient exhibit, there is a set of criteria to be met to reach an accurate diagnosis. Some of other related conditions to major depressive disorder (also called unipolar depression) are discussed by The American Psychiatric Association and the National Institute for Mental Health. Dysthymic Disorder or Persistent Depressive Disorder is a continuous long term form of mild depression. The less severe signs and symptoms occur sporadically and usually come and go over a period of years. Seasonal affective disorder, which comes and goes with seasons typically starting in late fall and early winter and going away during spring and summer. Perinatal depression, which occurs when a woman experiences major depression during pregnancy or after delivery (peripartum depression previously postpartum depression). Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) A woman with PMDD has severe symptoms of depressed mood, irritability, and tension about a week before menstruation begins.  Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is similar to PMDD however, PMS involves fewer and less severe symptoms than PMDD. People with bipolar disorder, formerly called manic depression, experience intense emotional states called mood episodes. These mood episodes are categorized as manic/hypomanic (abnormally happy or irritable mood) or depressive. The Psychology Of Depression The American Psychological Association explains the extent to which depression impacts people. Unlike sadness and grief, depression is deeper and longer and not necessarily situationally based. This is why people tend to withdraw from others, behave in manners which are abnormal from their usual personalities, and even lose interest in life. It as not uncommon for people who are experiencing sadness or grief to claim that they are feeling depressed. In the majority of cases, this is not clinically accurate. However, feeling sadness and grief for a long period of time, and not managed can turn into depression. Some people question the clinical legitimacy of depression and how it impacts people around the world.

Depression does not mean the end of an individual as story. As a matter of fact, many people have experienced depression, gotten the necessary treatment, and come back stronger than ever. There is always hope and room for rehabilitation and improvement. Psychotherapy Psychotherapy or talk therapy is one of the leading treatment options for depression, as noted by the American Psychiatric Association. There are various types of psychotherapy and Interpersonal Therapy is the most often used to treat depression. This manner of treatment is effective because it involves an individual working with a therapist who can get to know them, learn about their depression, and potential underlying factors. Once these things have been established, the psychotherapist can then begin helping their patient develop strategies, action plans, and techniques to reduce symptoms and overcome the disorder. When going through the process of psychotherapy, it as important for patients to remain open and receptive to feedback. Sometimes, the therapist may make statements or ask questions which are unexpected or surprising. Many times, therapists want to provoke new thoughts and ideas. A certain level of trust is important to the therapeutic process. It is the job of the therapist to establish a safe environment where everyone is free to be honest.  Medication Individuals who are going through depression may also be prescribed antidepressant medication. The specific medication which is prescribed can vary from person to person especially when there is an underlying medical condition such as heart disease. Whenever medication is involved, especially for treating depression, it is paramount that only a licensed doctor prescribes this medication. Under no circumstances should someone who is not a licensed doctor administer medicine to someone who is going through depression. This has the potential to exacerbate depression symptoms and any ongoing medical condition. Other Forms Of Treatment For Depression If medications do not reduce the severe symptoms of depression, brain stimulation therapies may be an option to explore.  Brain stimulation therapies used to treat severe depression include repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). ECT is a medical treatment that has been most reserved for patients with severe form of major depression who have not responded to other treatments.  Knowing That You Are Not Alone  Whenever an individual is faced with depression or another challenge, it can be easy to feel all alone in the world. As a matter of fact, this feeling is one of many reasons why isolating oneself from others is a common indicator of depression. However, no matter how scary things may seem, you are not alone. Many amazing people in this world can be there for you and help you if you allow them to do so. This is relevant, regardless of whether you are dealing with depression or something else entirely, such as any medical illness.

15 Symptoms Of Depression And Anxiety,Margaret Wack,"Anxiety and depression are some of the most common mental disorders today- and their prevalence is on the rise. The Center of Disease Control and Prevention reported that there has been a significant increase in the percentage of people in America exhibiting signs of anxiety or depression since the COVID-19 pandemic. Anxiety and depression can have a profound impact on work, relationships, and personal life, so it as important to receive a proper diagnosis in order to take the right steps to manage your mental health. Are You Looking For Guidance On How To Manage Your Anxiety Or Depression?Sign Up - We are Here To Help Anxiety and depression can often take different forms depending on age, gender, socialization, and cultural background, as well as personal differences unique to each individual. In men, anxiety and depression often manifest themselves in anger, irritability, and reckless behavior. Women are more likely to exhibit symptoms of depression including feelings of worthlessness, guilt, and persistent fatigue. In children and young adults, symptoms can vary from separation anxiety and clinginess to defiant behavior and trouble in school. If you are concerned that your child could be experiencing anxiety or depression, consider looking more into children's mental health and bringing up any concerns with their primary care provider. For older adults and seniors, depression and anxiety symptoms can include memory loss, substance misuse, and loss of interest in hobbies and activities. Many people want to avoid feeling like a burden in these situations, but reaching out for help is often the most powerful thing you can do. Not sure if you are going through depression or anxiety? While mental illness varies from person to person, there are a few common signs and symptoms to be on the lookout for. The more symptoms you experience and the longer you experience them for, the more likely you are to be dealing with a mental illness like anxiety or depression.  Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression   Excessive Worrying  If you find yourself constantly worrying about things, it could be a symptom of anxiety. While some worry is a normal part of everyday life, people going through anxiety deal with  excessive worry, even about things that might not otherwise seem very important. These worries are often intrusive and affect your thoughts and emotions even when you try your best to ignore them.    Feeling Restless or On Edge  Feelings of unexplained restlessness and tension can be another common symptom of anxiety. This can include a sense of impending doom or disaster, sometimes accompanied by fear or even panic. These feelings can be concentrated on a specific event, like loss of a job or a natural disaster, or they can be more diffuse. If you feel like you are constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop, you may be dealing with anxiety.   Muscle Tension  Constantly tense and physically wound up? Muscle tension is a physical symptom that often accompanies mental health issues, including anxiety. This constant tension leaves you feeling sore and physically exhausted, even when you haven at done any other physical activity. This prolonged tension can often be the source of  chronic pain and other recurring illnesses, so it as important to nip it in the bud before it becomes more severe.   Feelings of Worthlessness  People dealing with depression often experience a persistent feeling of worthlessness and low self-esteem. This can be a more general feeling or can be related to a specific area such as work, school, or personal relationships. While most people go through periods of self-doubt and uncertainty, the symptoms experienced by those dealing with depression are more intense and tend to persist regardless of external factors.   Excessive Guilt  Similar to feelings of worthlessness,  excessive guilt is another common symptom of depression. People can feel guilty for things they have or haven at done, often dwelling on past actions to an unhealthy extent. People can also feel guilty about their mental illness itself and the way it affects their personal and professional lives. These feelings of guilt are compounded by the other common symptoms of depression, such as withdrawal from personal relationships and failure to fulfill obligations at work and school. Guilt over symptoms of depression can be a vicious cycle, so it as important to seek help before you are caught in the spiral.   Withdrawing From Family and Friends  If you find yourself withdrawing from relationships with friends and family, you could be going through depression. People with depression often remove themselves from otherwise happy, healthy relationships, and struggle form new connections with others. They can often feel like a burden to those who care about them, or may simply be too exhausted and overwhelmed to deal with more social interaction. Lack of close relationships can also be a factor that leads to depression, so that social withdrawal can often further exacerbate existing mental illness. Are You Looking For Guidance On How To Manage Your Anxiety Or Depression?Sign Up - We are Here To Help   Reckless Behavior  Depression can often manifest itself in reckless behavior, including increased substance abuse and unsafe sex. This can also include risk-taking activities like reckless driving or getting into physical conflicts. More common in men than in women, these behaviors are often dangerous in and of themselves in addition to acting as a warning sign of mental health issues. If you find yourself drawn to reckless behaviors regardless of the consequences, consider seeking help.   Fatigue  One of the most common symptoms of depression and anxiety is fatigue, lethargy, and constant tiredness. If you feel like it as a struggle to get out of bed each morning or do anything other than the bare minimum, it could be a symptom of depression and anxiety. These feelings of tiredness and exhaustion can encompass both physical and mental sensations, and can often have significant negative impacts on your work and life. While chronic fatigue can often have other medical causes, including autoimmune disorders and other issues, it as worth having a professional make sure that you aren at dealing with mental illness. Here are some questions you can ask your doctor: What exactly are the symptoms of depression? In the most recent version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, clinical depression (also called major depressive disorder) was re-classified under a new category called depressive disorders. The diagnostic criteria for MDD for MDD requires that five of the following symptoms occur for at least two weeks:  Persistent depressed mood Loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities Psychomotor agitation or retardation Significant weight gain or loss, or increased/decreased appetite Changes in sleeping patterns Fatigue or low energy levels Extreme feelings of worthlessness or guilt Difficulty concentrating or making decisions Suicidal thoughts  If you or someone you know is having thoughts of self-harm, reach out for urgent help through the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-8255).  In addition to the above criteria, an individual's symptoms of depression must:  create significant impairment to daily functioning not be attributed to a medical condition or the side effects of medication taken for a chronic illness not be related to the effects of substance abuse not come after a previous manic or hypomanic episode (which may indicate the possibility of bipolar disorder) not be better explained by schizophrenia or related disorders  Living with depression can cause many emotional and physical problems that decrease an individual's quality of life. However, there is treatment available that can help to improve depressive symptoms. The American Psychiatric Association states that 80-90% of people respond positively to treatment. Common treatments for depression include psychotherapy, medication, or a combination of both. In some severe cases, brain stimulation therapies (such as electroconvulsive therapy) may be considered. In addition to professional treatment, other strategies that can help individuals to cope with depression include:  Prioritizing healthy habits (such as eating nutritious meals, getting regular exercise, and adequate sleep) Engaging in stress management techniques Connecting with trusted friends and family members who can provide emotional support Avoiding alcohol and recreational drugsâ€“ or addressing any substance abuse concerns that may be present.  What are the 4 main causes of depression? Depression is thought to occur as a result of a combination of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, risk factors that can increase an individual's risk of developing depression include:  Family history of depression Personal history of depression or other mental health conditions Stressful life events Living with chronic pain Serious medical conditions like heart disease or cancer Substance abuse  Due to the societal stigma around depression, some individuals may be hesitant to seek treatment. They may mistakenly believe that depression is a sign of weakness or something they should be able to just 'snap out of'. It is important to understand that depression is a mental illness that requires professional attention and support. If you are experiencing depression, know that what you are going through is not your fault, and there is treatment available that can help you to manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life. 9. Changes in Sleep Patterns Another frequently occurring symptom of both depression and anxiety is a significant change in sleep patterns. This can mean that you are getting much more sleep than you normally would and find it difficult to stay awake throughout the day. It can also manifest as persistent difficulty sleeping, and even insomnia. Other common sleep-related symptoms are trouble falling asleep or waking up earlier than usual. After a stressful or traumatic life event, it as pretty common to deal with disruptions to your sleep. But if these symptoms persist, you could be dealing with a mental health issue. Trouble with sleep can also have an outsized impact on the rest of your day, making it an especially important symptom to combat. 10. Changes in Appetite If you find yourself constantly overeating or eating much less than you used to, you could be experiencing another common symptom of anxiety and depression. Changes in appetite often accompany other symptoms like restlessness or fatigue. Anxiety and depression can also occur alongside eating disorders such as anorexia, bulimia, or binge eating, making them an especially dangerous combination. 11. Anger and Irritability Feeling angry all the time even without a clear reason? Anger and irritability are a common symptom of depression and anxiety, especially among men. These symptoms can often also have a significant impact on your relationships with others, making it more difficult to seek help or get support when you need it. 12. Physical Pain While depression and anxiety are mental illnesses, they can often have persistent physical symptoms. Physical pain, including headaches, cramps, and muscle soreness often accompanies other psychological symptoms. If you are in pain and can at identify a clear physical cause, it could be a symptom of an underlying mental issue. 13. Persistent Sadness Another hallmark of depression is a persistent feeling of sadness. While it as normal to experience feelings of sadness and melancholy after significant life events, feeling sad constantly can be a sign of something more serious. Whether you find yourself in the throws of despair or just feel like you are in a bad mood all the time without knowing why, you could be dealing with depression. 14. Trouble Concentrating If you have trouble concentrating on the task at hand, and instead find yourself constantly worrying about other things or losing focus completely, it could be a sign of anxiety and depression. This symptom can negatively affect work, school, and other areas of performance, and can make it more difficult to perform even basic tasks like preparing meals or completing household chores.    Suicidal Ideation  One of the most serious symptoms of mental health issues, suicidal ideation can take the form of persistent suicidal thoughts or even plans to commit suicide. If you are experiencing symptoms of suicidal ideation, be sure to get in touch with a mental health professional right away. You can reach out to the National Suicide Prevention Hotline online, or call them at 1-800-273-8255. While any of these symptoms taken individually might not be a sign of mental illness, if you are experiencing several of the above symptoms, you could be going through anxiety or depression. The good news is that these illnesses are common and treatable through a variety of methods, including medication and therapy. The American Psychiatric Association notes that most individuals who are treated for depression experience a reduction in their symptoms. Are you experiencing symptoms of depression or anxiety?

Practicing Mindfulness: Depression Treatment Without Medication,Mary Elizabeth Dean," What Is Mindfulness? When our brain is happy, we are happy. Mindfulness means being aware of the current state you are in, where you are, and calmly accepting your emotions, thoughts, and sensations. This is often used as an additional therapy technique to treat depression, anxiety, PTSD, along with a myriad of other conditions.  Different Ways To Meditate Are You Satisfied With Your Mindfulness Strategies?Discuss Strategies With A Therapist Now To begin, you want to get comfortable. Most people sit or lie down and close their eyes - it is essential to pick a position that you can stay in that will be comfortable for a period of time. First, you want to set a time limit for your session. This can range anywhere from 5 minutes on; it only depends on what you are comfortable with doing. It is often recommended that beginners start with a lesser amount of time to minimize the frustration that may occur as a result of struggling to stay mindful. As you become more accustomed to the process, you will be much better equipped to go for longer and longer. Many people report that mindfulness quickly becomes a part of their daily routine. It can be a very sacred time of the day, set apart for you to relax and enjoy the moment, free of worries and stress. When many people think of meditation, images of sitting cross-legged and pinching your fingers together while humming may come to mind. This is certainly an option for you if that is how you feel comfortable, but it is not the only way. The key to meditation is to relax and try to stay in the present moment. If you notice your mind wandering, try to steer it back to the present moment. I can be helpful to focus on your breathing while doing this. This will give your mind something to focus on other than your constant stream of to-do lists and activities of the day. Mindfulness can be a great tool to combat a variety of mental health issues because it will train your brain to realize when it is going off track, so you can reign it in when you start feeling the adverse effects of stress, anxiety, depression, or anything else.  Learn A Few Breathing Exercises A helpful tip to anyone new or accustomed to mindfulness is to do some research on breathing exercises. These can be invaluable to calm your inner self and mind in preparation for your session. Breathing exercises can also be utilized while meditating to calm yourself further and to keep your brain occupied. Consider the following: close your eyes, and focus on the sound of your own breathing. Breathe in through your mouth for 5 seconds, hold it for 5 seconds, and exhale for 10. Continue this until you feel your muscles relax and pay attention to your heart rate. To monitor your heart rate, you can place your thumb on the inside of your wrist and your index finger on the back. Apply a fair amount of pressure and adjust your thumb on the surface of your skin until you find your vein. You should be able to pick up your pulse. When you are stressed, you will notice your pulse will quicken. This is your body as natural reaction to stressors in your outside environment. As you practice your breathing exercises and focus your mind on the here and now, you will notice it start to slow. Once you are feeling completely relaxed and your heart rate is at a level, slow beat, this is the time to being meditating. With no outside stressors causing havoc to be wreaked within you, it is the perfect time to practice mindfulness. As a bonus, even when you are not meditating, breathing exercises can assist you in maintaining a sense of calm.  Try Not To Judge Yourself  Especially in the early stages of practicing mindfulness, you may discover yourself judging yourself for the practices. It can certainly be easy to get lost in what as ""normal"" or ""accepted"" in modern society, and also to feel a bit wacky when practicing mindfulness. Feeling self-conscious or judging yourself for not meditating the ""right"" way is common in the beginning. If you find your mind wandering or these self-critical thoughts coming up, let them come and go. They are temporary!  It as Okay If Your Mind Wanders You may find your mind wandering after a period of mindfulness, and this is completely normal! When it happens, just allow it to happen. You may even thank your thoughts for coming up, and then imagine them floating away from you. You can retrain your focus on the sensation of your breath in the moment, noting if it feels cooler or warmer on the inhale or exhale, and reground yourself back into the moment.  Humans Are Built For Mindfulness Whether we realize it or not, mindfulness is something that we already practice! Being present in the moment and acknowledging our feelings at the current time is mindfulness at its finest. Our brains are built to be mindful. This is our brain as natural defense against anxiety and other negatively impacting emotions. So the next time you sit down to practice mindfulness, remember that it is something you have been doing since birth.  Don at Believe The Skeptics There are many skeptics out there that think mindfulness is obscure or unusual. This is just not the case. It is a fundamental part of two mainstream forms of treatment for multiple mental health concerns including cognitive behavior therapy and dialectical behavior therapy. Mindfulness can take on many shapes and forms. Most of the time, this takes the shape of meditating, but many people interpret it in other ways such a relaxation time or just a moment to breathe. There is nothing unusual or obscure about it. With this information in your arsenal, you can walk with your head held high when speaking about mindfulness.  It as Not A Hype Because of its grown popularity over recent years, many might call mindfulness a hype or a fad. This couldn at be further from the truth. Mindfulness is simply a tool to be used to help bring peace and calm, and relief from stress, worry, and so much more. It is not a joke and shouldn at be treated as one. If you take the method seriously and invest your all into it, the results can be amazing. Research on mindfulness has shown that it helps with anxiety, depression, trauma related stress, and much more. There are world-renowned programs that utilize mindfulness to aid in the treatment of mental health problems and conditions like chronic pain.  Get A Professional Involved Are You Satisfied With Your Mindfulness Strategies?Discuss Strategies With A Therapist Now If you are struggling with finding a method that works for you, or you just can at get the hang of mindfulness on your own, there is another way!  A trained counselor or therapist can be vital in assisting you to succeed using this method.

Are Masturbation And Depression Linked In Any Way?,Robert Porter,"Depression is a very serious problem and it impacts the lives of millions of people. Knowing this, there are many people out there who wonder what causes depression. Some people have heard that masturbation is a potential cause of depression. This information is actually erroneous and masturbation should not be associated with depression, anxiety, or any other mainstream mental illnesses. Could Impulse Control Be Affecting You Or Someone You Know?Click Here To Find Out Some people have falsely said things about masturbation and linked it to depression issues or major depressive disorder.  People have heard of these stories and rumors have been spread about the potential negative impact that masturbation can have on your life. The truth of the matter is that masturbation is simply a normal part of human behavior. Sometimes people masturbate in order to obtain sexual satisfaction or to relieve stress, and it as generally a normal expression of human sexuality. If this is true, then why did people start thinking that a mental illness like depression and masturbation are linked in any way? This is a complicated topic but it mostly has to do with a misunderstanding. You see, people might wind up having feelings of shame or loneliness after masturbating due to the stigma that has been placed on it. This could wind up leading to feelings of depression, but that doesn at mean that masturbation and depression are intrinsically linked.  Masturbation Is A Normal And Healthy Habit Masturbation should be viewed as a normal and healthy habit. In fact, it has been shown that masturbation helps with stress relief and may even offer more than a few health benefits. Many people understand this and don at see anything wrong with expressing the fact that they masturbate on occasion. Others are going to be so embarrassed by masturbating that they will go to great lengths to try to hide it. It is a deeply personal act, but it isn at something that you should feel ashamed of. It as true that men masturbate more than women.  According to a survey, 23.4% of men ages 25-29 admit to masturbating two or three times per week. In that same survey, 7.9% of women ages 25-29 say that they masturbate at least two or three times per week. You also have to keep in mind that some people are embarrassed to speak about the topic, so the numbers are actually likely much higher. Regular masturbation is a way for people to relieve stress and to alleviate sexual frustrations. It shouldn at be a source of depression as it is simply something that everyone does from time to time. When masturbation is followed by depression, it is usually caused due to loneliness or feeling like what they are doing is wrong.

Depression After Miscarriage: Dealing With A Unique Kind Of Loss,Julia Thomas,"Many people falsely assume that miscarriage is uncommon, perhaps even rare. They don't hear about it so they don't understand how often it happens. But the fact is that between 10 and 15 percent of known pregnancies end in miscarriage. Another thing that's often overlooked is that when a person loses a pregnancy, they may go through a period of intense grief. Beyond that, they may become depressed during this difficult time. The good news is that depression is very treatable but you have to recognize it's happening before you can get help. What Does Depression Look Like After Miscarriage? In a way, depression is depression. It comes with a certain set of symptoms, no matter what triggered it. However, these symptoms may show up differently for people who have lost a pregnancy. Here are some of the signs to watch for if you're concerned you might be depressed. Depressed Mood A depressed mood brings feelings of sadness. It's natural that you would be sad after losing a pregnancy. After all, you've probably already bonded to this new life. This can be true no matter how early the pregnancy ended. Your hopes for the future may begin to arise as soon as you know you're pregnant. Now, those hopes have been dashed, and you feel an overwhelming burden of sadness. You may cry frequently and consistently. Loss of Pleasure or Interest One of the main signs of depression is the loss of pleasure, also called anhedonia. Things that once made you feel happy and joyful don't have that effect anymore. If you get a promotion at work, you may not feel the pleasure of success. The joy of spending time with friends may elude you. You might stop engaging in activities you used to enjoy or avoiding social situations you once found pleasurable. Trouble Sleeping Are You In Need Of Strong Emotional Support After A Miscarriage?We Can Help. Chat With A Board-Certified Counselor Sleep problems are a classic sign of depression. You may have trouble going to sleep or staying asleep. Or you may find yourself sleeping much more than usual. At first, sleep problems may be partly due to the changes that are happening in your body. However, if sleep problems continue, they may be due to depression. Concentration Problems If you're having trouble concentrating on the things that are going on in your life now, it could be a sign you're getting depressed. You may have trouble completing tasks that require you to focus. You may have trouble noticing details, often feeling distracted or disconnected from your life. Appetite Changes Your appetite may change in depression. You may have intense cravings and feel like eating nearly all the time. Or, more likely, you may feel like nothing tastes good anymore. You may completely lose interest in food and mealtimes. Grieving The Loss Grief is not the same thing as depression. Grief is a natural process that helps you come to terms with your loss and prepare yourself for the next phase in your life. Depression is not natural, and it serves no healthy purpose. Yet, grief can sometimes get sidetracked into depression, especially if you don't give yourself the time and permission to go through the grieving process in the way that's best for you. This can be difficult, especially if you don't have a strong support system. Some people in your life may not understand that you need to grieve after a miscarriage. They may not see how it could affect you much. While they may be well-meaning, their assessment of the situation is way off the mark. You do have every right to grieve. You've suffered a significant loss. Here are some thoughts and feelings that may come as you're grieving. You already know you can't go back to the way things were before the miscarriage. So what can you do about the emotional distress you're feeling right now? The first thing you can do is to recognize your feelings and accept them as a part of what you're going through. Common feelings after a miscarriage include:  Disbelief Numbness Shock Guilt Anger Sadness  Shock And Denial At first, it may be hard for you to believe that you're no longer pregnant. You may question whether your doctor was right in saying that you miscarried. This denial could only go on for a few days, but in other cases, you might experience it for much longer. Emotional Rollercoaster  You may feel a flood of conflicting emotions in the weeks and even months after your loss. It's important to remember that those emotions may have a lot to do with the hormonal changes that are happening to you immediately after the miscarriage and for several months afterward. These hormonal changes can intensify your emotions. Your emotions also may change often, giving you a feeling of being on an emotional rollercoaster. Unearned Guilt Feelings of guilt often come up for people who have miscarried. You may blame yourself, thinking that surely there was something you could have done to prevent it. But the truth is that this kind of guilt is usually completely unearned. Chances are the problem wasn't in something you did or didn't do. Feeling excessive guilt is a symptom of depression, not a sign that you deserve all that self-blame. Anger And A Sense That Life Is Unfair Anger is also a part of the grieving process for many people after miscarriage, and you may see a lot of potential targets for your anger. You might be angry at yourself, your partner, or your doctor. You may feel that someone should have done something to prevent this. Or you might be angry with people when they aren't compassionate enough or don't know the right way to console you. Your anger may even expand to your God or the universe. Life may seem extremely cruel and unfair. Accepting The Loss Sooner or later, there may come a time when you can accept that this loss happened. That doesn't mean you'll ever forget about the miscarriage or the child you were expecting. It also doesn't mean you'll never have moments of sadness about it again. It simply means that you're aware that despite the loss, your life will go on and it will change to suit your new life situation. You finally feel that it's okay to concentrate on other things, feel moments of joy, and live your life in a way that fits with your new circumstances â€“ all without forgetting this very important loss in your life. What You Can Do About Depression After Miscarriage After a miscarriage, you may feel helpless and hopeless, especially if you're depressed. However, you don't have to live the rest of your life in misery. There are some things you can do for yourself and other things you can do with the help of a therapist. Here are some ways to overcome depression after miscarriage. Things You Can Do for Yourself There are several things you can do to prevent or deal with depression after miscarriage. First, allow yourself to grieve. It doesn't matter if someone else doesn't understand why you're grieving. You have the right and the need to grieve. Second, talk to close friends or relatives about what you're feeling and going through. Get support from the people in your life who are compassionate, understanding, and helpful. Third, take good care of your physical health, even if you don't feel like it right now. Depression can get worse if you don't eat the right amounts of healthy food, get adequate sleep, or get any exercise. It may be very hard to think of healthy habits after what you've been through, but it's important to remember that your physical health is naturally going to affect your mental health. Ways A Therapist Can Help You Are You In Need Of Strong Emotional Support After A Miscarriage?We Can Help. Chat With A Board-Certified Counselor Many people who have miscarried benefit from talking to a therapist. Your counselor provides strong emotional support. They listen nonjudgmentally, giving you opportunities to talk about things that might be uncomfortable to talk about with others. They'll help you give yourself permission to grieve in your own unique ways. Your therapist may also provide psychoeducation, teaching you about issues you're going through, including both grief and depression. You may learn things you never knew before about miscarriage, depression, and taking care of your mental health. What's more, a therapist can help you sort out your mixed-up feelings about the loss. They can provide grief counseling to help you deal with all the various aspects of your grief, from its physical and emotional impact on you to the way it affects your social and spiritual life. Seeking mental health help may be something you've never done before. So, it might be a bit scary or uncomfortable to consider it now. However, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks for most people who are struggling with emotional issues. The good news is that it's easy to connect with a therapist at BetterHelp.

Meditation For Depression: 7 Mood-Lifting Benefits,Kelly Spears,"Content Warning: This article discusses potentially triggering topics such as suicide. If you think you may hurt yourself or attempt suicide, reach out to 911 or call a suicide hotline. In the U.S., you can dial 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255) to reach the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Or, use the webchat atsuicidepreventionlifeline.org/chat. Meditation is a powerful practice. In fact, it can actually change the level of activity in your brain! While virtually anyone can experience the positive effects of meditation, certain studies show that people dealing with depression are especially likely to reap the benefits of daily meditation practice. Unfortunately, the mere mention of meditation as a self-care practice is frequently met with skepticism. It is largely misunderstood and often viewed as an unscientific practice with no proven benefits. Nothing could be further from the truth, however. Countless researchers are finding scientific evidence that meditation can be life-changing for many people, including those facing depression. Unfortunately, many common treatments for depression, such as antidepressant medications and psychotherapy, don't work for everyone. Many people don't try meditation until they are severely depressed and desperate. Below, you'll learn just how many people are dealing with depression as well as how meditation affects the brain. You'll also be introduced to helpful resources for meditation newcomers, many of which are free! Depression Facts Could Meditation Help You Manage Anxiety?Click Here To Find Out Before we delve into the benefits of meditation for depression, it's helpful to know that you are not alone, as evidenced by the following findings and statistics:   Major Depressive Disorder (Mdd) Affects Over 16 Million American Adults Every Year, according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA). That's nearly 7 percent of the U.S. population. Women Are Diagnosed With Depression Much More Frequently Than Men.In fact, the Mayo Clinic reports that women are twice as likely to be diagnosed with depression. Many people believe this is due to the natural hormonal changes that women experience throughout their lifetime. While fluctuations in hormones can certainly affect mood, these changes aren't the primary cause of depression. This number may also be skewed due to the stigma that surrounds menseeking treatment, general difficulty for men in reporting depression symptoms, and the varied symptoms of depression men may experience.   Depression Is Incredibly Complex. It's widely believed that a chemical imbalance is at the root of depression, but this explanation simplifies the complexity of the disease. As Harvard Medical School explains, depression can result from a combination of many factors, including ""faulty mood regulation by the brain, genetic vulnerability, stressful life events, medications, and medical problems."" In many cases, depression results from a mishmash of biological and environmental factors. Stress and anxiety are also known to be major contributors.   Depression Often Co-occurs With Other Physical And Mental Health Conditions, according to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIH). These include anxiety disorders, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.  Not sure if you're dealing with depression? We've outlined the symptoms below: Symptoms Of Depression  Sadness Lack of interest in activities you previously pursued and enjoyed Fatigue and low energy Appetite and weight changes Sleep problems, such as sleeping too much or too little Difficulty making decisions and concentrating Feeling worthless and shameful Restlessness Slowed speech and movements Suicidal thoughts  If you think you may hurt yourself or attempt suicide, reach out to 911 or call a suicide hotline. In the U.S., you can dial 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255) to reach the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Or, use the webchat atsuicidepreventionlifeline.org/chat.

The Link Between Meditation And Depression  Now that we've covered common causes, facts, and symptoms of depression, let's look at the seven mood-lifting benefits of beginning a meditation practice:    Meditation Can Change Your Reactions To Negative Feelings  As mentioned previously, depression is often triggered by stress and anxiety. In an interview with Harvard Health, Dr. John W. Denninger explained that meditation could shift a person's perspective. ""Meditation trains the brain to achieve sustained focus, and to return to that focus when negative thinking, emotions, and physical sensations intrude â€“ which happens a lot when you feel stressed and anxious,"" Dr. Denninger told the publication. Although this shift in focus isn't likely to take place immediately, a regular meditation practice can positively affect a person's reactions to stress and anxiety, which may lead to a less depressed state. As a bonus, many people notice a marked decrease in anxiety when meditating regularly, which can result in a domino effect.   Meditation Can Silence The Brain's ""fear Center""  You may have heard the brain's amygdala referred to as the ""fear center"" or ""worry center"" because it controls the ""fight or flight""response, and is constantly on the lookout for something to worry about or fear. During a study conducted by Boston University and Harvard Medical School, researchers ordered brain scans for each participant before and after an 8-week mindfulness meditation class. They report that, in the group that meditated, they ""found a trend increase in right amygdala response to negative images, which was significantly correlated with a decrease in depression score.""   Meditation Teaches Us To Live In The Moment  If you face depression, you may consider yourself a ""worry wart"" or an ""over-thinker."" Rather than worrying about the future or dwelling on the past, meditation teaches us to focus on the here and now, which can help keep fears and regrets at bay. Luckily, focusing on the present extends way beyond a meditation session. People who meditate tend to live in the moment throughout the day. They're often able to better enjoy the little things in life, leave the past behind them, and trust that they'll be okay no matter what the future holds.   Meditation Encourages A Healthier Mindset  Depression often goes hand in hand with a scarcity mindsetâ€”i.e. the belief that something is lacking in our lives, or something is missing or broken within us. Meditating makes us more aware of our thought patterns and allows us to gradually shift our thoughts to a more positive, abundant mindset. The Chopra Center suggests setting an intention to clear the mind by meditating or setting aside quiet time every day to ""allow new abundant possibilities to come to light.""   Meditation Strengthens The Hippocampus  The hippocampus is an essential part of the brain that allows us to absorb information and transfer that info to memory. This region of the brain also plays a key role in emotional regulation, which is vital for responding to emotional experiences. Studies show that major depression can even cause the hippocampus to shrink. Luckily, this reduction in size doesn't have to be permanent. Meditation can add volume to this region of the brain, restoring all the key functions the hippocampus is responsible for.   Meditation Makes The Prefrontal Cortex Stronger  The brain's prefrontal cortex greatly impacts our day-to-day lives. This part of the brain is largely responsible for working memory, decision-making, self-expression, complex planning, and how we conduct ourselves in social situations.Individuals who face depression tend to have an underdeveloped prefrontal cortex. However, this region of the brain can thicken through regular meditation. Perhaps the most encouraging finding of all is the fact that the prefrontal cortex can be strengthened like a muscle. In an interview with The Washington Post, Harvard neuroscientist Sara Lazar explained that the prefrontal cortex shrinks as we ageâ€”but it doesn't have to! Through her research, Lazar found that a 50-year-old who meditates has the equivalent gray matter in the prefrontal cortex as a 25-year-old. Now, that's good news!   Meditation Can Reduce The Risk Of Relapse  Unfortunately, history tends to repeat itself when it comes to depression. Individuals who have experienced recurrent depression are at an increased risk for future depressive episodes. While antidepressant medications can be effective, they don't work for everyone, and they can stop working overtime. Meditation, as part of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), can decrease the risk of relapse. This type of therapy is just as effective as antidepressantsâ€”without the frustrating side effects. People with a history of depression tend to think negatively about themselves. MBCT brings awareness to this pattern, allowing individuals to respond differently to these negative thoughts and emotions by instilling a more compassionate mindset. How To Start A Meditation Practice Establishing a daily meditation practice doesn't require fancy clothes or equipment, and it doesn't need to take much time either. Read the following tips, take a deep breath, and simply begin:  Strive For Practice, Not Perfection. Set an intention to meditate each day, and practice compassion if you miss a day or two. Like any new habit, it will take some time before your meditation becomes second nature. Associate  Your Meditation Practice With An Activity You Already Do Every Day. Many people prefer to meditate first thing in the morning. They may get up, use the restroom, eat breakfast, brush their teeth, and meditate before starting their work or school day. You may choose to meditate right after work or after drinking a cup of tea in the evening. Try meditating at different times of the day to determine what works best for you.   Be Flexible. Life happens. You may have to skip your morning meditation after hitting the snooze button one too many times. In this case, aim to meditate later in the day.   Remember Quality Over Quantity. Don't attempt to meditate for an hour when you begin your practice unless you're enjoying the experience. As you become more comfortable with your practice, you can increase the time you spend meditating.   Try Guided Meditations. There is a plethora of great guided meditations online. Dr. Kristin Neff offers seven free guided meditations on her website, all of which focus on self-compassion. This 5-minute meditation is a great place to start.   Try Group Meditation. Look for a meditation group in your area. While meditation is intended to be an individual experience, it can be uplifting to practice in a group setting.   Try A Meditation App. There are so many great meditation apps available for your smartphone or tablet. A few notable options are Insight Timer, Calm, Headspace, and Waking Up.  Could Meditation Help You Manage Anxiety?Click Here To Find Out    Prioritize Your Practice. Schedule your meditation just like you would schedule an important meeting or appointment. Jot it down in your planner or put a reminder in your phone. Create a sacred space. Designate a cozy spot in your home to meditate. You may choose to add a comfy chair, pillow, or blanket. You can also include your favorite photos, candles, or books.   Just Start. The most important step of meditation is beginning. Whether you have a dedicated space or an app truly doesn't matter so long as you make the effort to start.  Some questions you can ask your therapist include: Does meditation actually help depression?What type of meditation is best for depression?How long does it take for meditation to help depression?How do you meditate in bed?Can you meditate while on antidepressants?Is crying after meditation normal?How can I control my mind from unwanted thoughts?Why does meditation help anxiety?What are the benefits of meditation?What is the difference between mindfulness and meditation?",2022-08-09,Self care
How The Depression Stigma Hurts Society,Stephanie Kirby,"What do you think of when you hear mental health? Many people in society think of someone with some kind of problem. Others jump to thinking about things like violence and mass shootings. All of these things have come from the stigma that surrounds mental health. And, this isn at just for disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder; there is also a depression stigma that is hurting our society. The Depression Stigma Hurts - Learn How You Can Change ItLearn More About Mental Health Conditions Online.  What Is the Stigma? In the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, stigma is defined as ""a set of negative and often unfair believes that a society or group of people have about something."" One of the biggest problems with stigma is that it as not usually based on the truth. There are many myths that float around society about mental health. These myths help to feed this negative stigma that surrounds mental health and depression. In his book,  Transforming Stigma, author Mike Veny describes that three things are typically included in stigma. They include stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination. He goes on to explain that, ""Stereotypes are related to thoughts; prejudice comes from feelings; discrimination relates to a person as behavior."" So, when someone believes a stereotype about depression, it impacts how they feel about mental health disorders. Their feelings then impact the way that they behave. Here as what this looks like in real life. Someone believes that a person with depression is crazy and dangerous. Disbelief causes them to feel afraid if they find out that they are around someone who struggles with depression. So, when they are confronted face to face with someone and find out that that person is depressed, they treat them differently based on their fear. Mike Veny goes on in his book to explain that, ""The effect of stigma on those who could benefit from help is devastating, and it as something that needs to change. With nearly 66% of people with a diagnosable mental illness not seeking out treatment, society is suffering from stigma, and people are not able to live their lives to the fullest because of it.""  Who Does The Stigma Hurt? You may think that this answer is obvious. Stigma hurts a person that has been diagnosed with depression and others with mental health disorders. However, it as not as simple as that. The depression stigma hurts everyone in society. Those that have been diagnosed with anxiety or depressive disorders are hurt by the stigma in a few ways. The first is that if they believe the stigma themselves, so they buy into it. It makes them feel ashamed of themselves and what they are going through. This leads them to keep quiet about it or trying to ignore it. It also impacts the way that they are able to deal with other people. They try to hide their diagnosis and what they are going through because they don at know what other people will think of them. But that as not all. The depression stigma also hurts those that don at have depression. It causes them unnecessary fear and anxiety in life. It causes them to potentially hurt friends and family that they love that are struggling with depression. If you are talking to someone that has mental health diagnoses that you don at know about and you refer to others with the same disorders as crazy or scary or dangerous, you are damaging your relationship with that person from your prejudice. By allowing the stigma to continue, we are stopping people from getting the help that they need. Depression is an incredibly treatable disorder. There are multiple forms of treatment available, including traditional medicine and holistic approaches. However, if someone is embarrassed to admit that they are having a problem because of the depression stigma, they are not going to reach out for the help in the treatment that they need.   Stigma Leads Down A Dangerous Road When people aren at able to get the treatment that they need with depression, depression can continue to grow. When left untreated, it can slowly take over entire life of a person, making them unable to function in their daily life. This can lead to isolation, suicidal thoughts, and possibly suicide. Suicide rates, while lowering around the world, are  continuing to rise in the United States. This is a problem that needs to be addressed by all of society, not just mental health professionals. We need to begin to challenge the myth surrounding depression and mental health that are out there. If you or someone you know is experiencing suicidal thoughts, help is available. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline can be reached at 1-800-273-8255 and is available 24/7, or you can text the word ""HOME"" to 741741 to reach the Crisis Text Line.  How Do We End the Stigma? So how do we put an end to the depression stigma? First, whether you deal with depression or not, realize that you can make a difference in ending the stigma. The first thing that you need to do is educate yourself on depression. Learn what the truth is and learn how to spot the myths that are out there in society. If you struggle with depression yourself, your first step is learning how to overcome the stigma that you believe, so you are able to get the help that you need without feeling ashamed or embarrassed. Then, get the help that you need and learn how to take care of yourself. Practice things like meditation and journaling to be able to process your thoughts and feelings on depression. Then, replace any negative beliefs that you have about depression or yourself with rational ones.  We Need to Change Our Words If you are guilty of using labels with depression or mental health, it as time to stop. It doesn at matter if you are using them on yourself or other people, they are damaging to society as beliefs of depression and mental health. Commit to eliminating these labels from your vocabulary. Learn the correct terms for mental health disorders and the correct way to use them. There are also minor changes that people diagnosed with depression and mental health are trying to make. This includes saying things like mental health challenge instead of mental illness. There as a huge stigma that surrounds the term ""mental illness."" One way to overcome the stigma it as to stop using this term and to start using a different one. The mental health industry is also working to transform the way that society talks about people with disorders. It as important to use what is called people first language. An example of this is instead of saying ""she as depressed,"" you would say ""she has depression."" This is a slight change, but it puts the person first. It shows that they have a diagnosis and not that they are the diagnosis.  Share Your Depression Story Depression is something that a lot of people don at like to talk about. It makes them feel embarrassed or vulnerable. Most likely because of the stigma that surrounds it. But, if you want to make a difference in ending the stigma, it as important that people start speaking up. That means if you have struggled with depression in your life, consider sharing your story and talk about it. The Depression Stigma Hurts - Learn How You Can Change ItLearn More About Mental Health Conditions Online. You sharing your story could be the inspiration that someone else needs to share their story. The more people that share their story, the easier it will be for society to realize that depression is not dangerous, it doesn at mean people are crazy, and it as a lot more common than they believe. These changes will encourage other people that are struggling to see that they can get help and that they don at have anything to be ashamed about.  Call It Out If You See Someone Feeding The Stigma Now that you are aware on the topic of depression stigma, you all be able to recognize when others are acting in it. If you notice this, there is nothing wrong with politely correcting the person. Help educate them on depression and the importance of putting an end to the stigma that surrounds it. This is also important to do in the media. Many people believe anything that they see in the media so if they are constantly hearing things that are feeding the stigma that is what they are going to believe. If you see news coverage or even things on social media that stigmatized depression, don at be afraid to reach out to address the situation. You never know who you are going to be helping by doing that.  Don at Be Afraid To Get the Help That You Need If you are struggling with depression, do not allow the stigma to stop you from getting the help that you need. Depression is treatable, and you don at need to be ashamed to reach out for help.  BetterHelp offers online counseling so you can get started anywhere you have an internet connection and a smart phone, tablet, or computer.

The book has daily exercises or homework, much like you would get from a therapist.  Getting Help While some of these books are written to be self-help books, it is important to recognize that a book alone is not sufficient treatment for clinical depression. It is important that you understand that self-help books can only take you so far. While they can help you, it is most helpful if you read these books in conjunction with psychotherapy. This way you can ask questions about what you have read and learn how to apply the techniques to your life. As mentioned, it is best if you talk to your therapist about what books are right for you. This is only a partial list of the available books about depression. A therapist that has worked with you for several sessions will best be able to recommend the books that will both do you the most good and support your current journey through psychotherapy. If you are feeling as though you might be suffering from depression and need help, contact a  therapist as soon as possible. It may seem like a good idea to try to help yourself first, but you should seek help so that you can get an accurate diagnosis and effective treatment. Depression can be a symptom of other mental illnesses, so it is important to see a therapist or psychiatrist for proper evaluation and diagnosis before trying to go it alone.",2022-09-01,Education
Which Natural Supplements Help With Depression?,BetterHelp,"Take Charge of Your Depression SymptomsTalk With A Certified Therapist Online. People who struggle with depression may look far and wide to find something that will help them on an ongoing basis. They want something that as safe, effective, and affordable. Natural Supplements for depression include vitamins, minerals, herbal remedies, and other supplements. The only problem is that so many options are available, it may be difficult to settle on one supplement. Still, with the right information, you can choose wisely.  Vitamins For Depression Vitamins for depression have the advantage of being a low-cost option. They are also safe and easy to find at your local pharmacy or even at the grocery store. The following vitamins have been used to help with depression.  Vitamin B3 Also known as niacin, Vitamin B-6 is a vitamin that is needed for the production of serotonin. Because low serotonin levels are common in people with depression, B3 is thought to be helpful in improving mood by increasing that neurotransmitter. A dose of 20 mg can be helpful, but you may need more if you have more severe depression. Niacin can cause flushing, but there are niacin supplements that have a non-flushing feature.  Vitamin B6 Vitamin B-6 is named pyridoxine, but most people know it simply as B-6. Vitamin B-6 has many physical and neurological benefits. B-6 is extremely important to keep the nerves functioning appropriately. It as especially important for women who have PMS and have depression due to hormonal imbalances. Birth control pills deplete B-6, so it as important to take a B-6 supplement if you take birth control. A dose of 25 mg is usually best, but you may need more if you are taking birth control pills.  Vitamin B9 Vitamin B-9 also goes by the names of folate and folic acid. Its primary use in the body is to help with creating new cells. Like Vitamin B-3, folate helps with the production of serotonin so that a deficiency can cause depression. Talk to your doctor about what dose to take, but usually, 400 mcg is recommended.   Vitamin B12 Vitamin B-12 has long been touted as a great energy-booster. Many people have  low B-12 levels, and 9% of the population is deficient in this vitamin. Vitamin B-12 However, it as still unclear how much  B-12 helps with depression. One review of the research found that there was little evidence it helps in the short-term, but it may be helpful over a longer period.  Vitamin C Vitamin C, also called ascorbic acid, is more popular for preventing colds. However, some people take it for help with depression. Vitamin C also helps the body absorb iron. There is some scientific evidence supporting the use of Vitamin C for depression, including one study of  breast cancer patients that found that intravenous Vitamin C did reduce depression and improved several other quality of life factors at the same time. Another study found that Vitamin C was especially helpful for  older adults living with depression and cognitive decline. Dosage should be at least 100 mg per day, but no more than 2000 mg per day.  Vitamin D Of all the vitamins for depression, Vitamin D is one of the best supplements for depression. About 75% of adults have Vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D aids with cognitive function and a deficiency can lead to depression. You can get your D by sitting in the sunlight for at least 20 minutes a day. If you prefer a supplement, 2,000 IU is the preferred dose.Here are some questions you can ask your doctor: What supplements may help depression? What vitamin is a natural antidepressant?

Take Charge of Your Depression SymptomsTalk With A Certified Therapist Online.  Inositol Inositol is included in this section because it is considered a ""vitamin-like"" substance found in plants and animals. Inositol is helpful for physical problems like diabetes, menopause, and polycystic ovary syndrome. It as also used for several mental conditions, including schizophrenia, autism, ADHD, bipolar disorder, OCD, panic disorder, and yes, depression. The research support is mixed, but one study did find that inositol may be effective as an add-on treatment for  bipolar depression.  Minerals For Depression Some minerals may be helpful as supplements for depression. Like vitamins, minerals are also inexpensive and easy to find. It as important to remember that minerals need to be taken in the appropriate dosage. Too little won at have any effect, but too much can cause physical problems.  Chromium People need only a very small amount of chromium, but still, up to 50% of American adults are deficient in chromium. Chromium is important for balancing blood sugar levels as well as regulating brain chemicals like serotonin and melatonin. Take 200 mcg is you don at get it from dietary sources like potatoes and animal protein.  Iron Iron can be a helpful supplement for depression, but it as crucial that you don at take too much. Low iron levels can lead to low energy and mood problems. Taking iron may help you with chronic fatigue and depression. Take about 10 mg twice a day and no more.  Magnesium Many people have found a benefit in taking magnesium for depression. In fact, one study concluded that magnesium brought about swift recovery from major depression in  less than seven days in some instances. The same study suggested that magnesium deficiency might be a factor in most cases of major depression. Nearly half of Americans get less than the daily recommended amount of  magnesium. The reason magnesium and depression treatment go together so well is the magnesium promotes relaxation and helps with the production of hormones in the brain. To make sure you get enough, you can take 320 mg to 450 mg supplement per day. Take it a night to help with insomnia.  Zinc Like chromium, zinc is a mineral you don at need much to be healthy. Low levels of zinc can cause a host of physical and mental disorders, including depression. The recommended daily requirements for zinc range from 11 mg to 14 mg, depending on your gender and age. However, as a treatment for depression, the recommended dose is  25 mg daily for 12 weeks.  Herbal Supplements For Depression Herbal supplements for depression are sometimes more expensive and harder to find than vitamins and minerals. However, many people find them more beneficial or want to take them in addition to vitamins and minerals. Several herbal remedies have been used for depression.  Ayahuasca  Ayahuasca is an interesting choice in natural supplements for depression. It comes from a plant found in the Amazon. In a recent study, Ayahuasca gave six patients with recurrent depression fast-acting relief. About half the subjects experienced vomiting. However, this herbal remedy gave quick relief that lasted in the long-term.   Betaine Anhydrous Betaine anhydrous is a natural chemical in the body and foods like beets, spinach, and red wine. When  combined with SAMe, it has been shown more effective for the treatment of depression than the antidepressant amitriptyline. However, other studies have shown no effect.  Blueberry Blueberry fruit and leaves can be used to make herbal supplements for depression. If you take a supplement based on blueberry, make sure it isn at bilberry, which is called blueberry in some parts of the world. Blueberry is different. It has shown a small amount of evidence that it might be somewhat effective for depression if the cause of the depression is a  clot in a blood vessel in the brain.  Chlorella Chlorella is a type of algae that has been used in natural supplements for anxiety and depression. In one study,  chlorella was shown effective for treating major depressive disorder as well as anxiety. It helped with both physical and cognitive symptoms of depression.  Green Tea Green tea has powerful antioxidants, so it as beneficial for general health. It has also been used as a supplement for depression. IT improves the balance and function of neurotransmitters. It also has up to 4% caffeine, which helps with cognitive function and increases the release of neurotransmitters.  Lavender  Lavender has been used for depression, but there as little evidence to support using it for that purpose. One study found that it had no effect for depression but did decrease anxiety.  Lemon Balm  Lemon balm is an herb from the mint family, called lemon balm because of the lemony smell of its leaves. The jury is still out on whether lemon balm helps with depression or not. It has been shown effective in studies using rats as subjects, and it may yet be proven effective for helping with depression in humans.   Rhodiola Rosea Rhodiola Rosea is a plant used in herbal remedies. Studies have shown that Rhodiola is effective in helping with depression. It helps with depression symptoms like poor work performance, sleep problems, poor appetite, irritability, and fatigue. It affects the levels of monoamines in the brain.  Saffron Saffron is an herb often used in rice dishes. It has been used to treat depression. In fact, in one study, saffron at a dose of 30 mg per day was about  as effective as fluoxetine for treating mild to moderate depression.  Saint John as Wort Saint John as wort is a popular folk remedy for depression that comes from a flowering plant. As it turns out, it is effective for reducing depression symptoms. In one study, it was  combined with folic acid and given to subjects. The study concluded that the combination worked by helping serotonin and noradrenalin break down and helped with regulating serotonin receptors. It reduced depression, and the only side effect was increased sensitivity to UV light.  Turmeric Many people take the spice  turmeric or curcumin (an ingredient in turmeric) in depression supplements. While curcumin shows some promise as an herbal remedy for depression, it is far from a proven treatment.  Therapy: Another Natural Treatment For Depression Another way to decrease your depression symptoms naturally is through psychotherapy. Therapy can be beneficial on its own or when combined with medications or supplements for depression. It as a safe treatment that doesn at interfere with the medications you take or other medical conditions. In therapy, you can learn relaxation techniques. You can find out how to stop ruminating over sad or distressing circumstances. You can examine your thoughts and choose more helpful ones through cognitive behavioral therapy. You can talk to a licensed counselor for convenient, private online therapy at  BetterHelp.com. If depression is an ongoing problem for you, starting therapy can be just the help you need to feel better. As your mood improves, you can perform better at work, have more satisfying relationships, and live the life that suits you best.",2022-09-01,Self care
Understanding And Recognizing The Warning Signs Of Depression,Sarah Fader ,"Clinical depression is one of the most misunderstood illnesses in our society today. People often claim to be ""depressed"" due to a failed relationship (male depression after divorce is becoming increasingly common), an unexpected life change or one of the many minor tragedies that everyone experiences in life, but this is miles away from the meaning a counselor or psychologist attaches to the word. Many people don at even realize that they are experiencing depression. Trying to determine whether someone else is, even if you know that person well, is extremely difficult. There is absolutely no way on earth to see inside another human being as mind, and this is true for a highly qualified psychiatrist as much as the man in the street. Don at Ignore The Warning Signs Of Depression. Get The Support You Deserve & NeedSpeak With A Licensed Depression Therapist The best we can do is to rely on external behaviors and cues, all of which can originate from a variety of causes and are extremely easy to misinterpret. Some individuals are highly demonstrative when it comes to their emotions while others, who may be experiencing equally strong feelings, tend not to show this externally. For example, some people are extremely introverted. It can be hard to determine whether an introverted person is depressed because they are quiet and often internalize their feelings. Another thing to keep in mind is when a person starts behaving out of the ordinary for them, for example, a change in routine can have a variety of explanations: someone who no longer goes out with his friends as often as before might be depressed and avoiding people, or working longer hours, or may have a new girlfriend. All of these are likely explanations. In addition, many people who experience depression don at want to put themselves out there. Maybe they are afraid of being stigmatized or put into a box. They may regard depression as a weakness that will affect their standing within some group dynamic, or they might not want those close to them to worry about them. It could be uncomfortable for them to reveal their emotions to another person, or they might just not like the idea of others feeling sorry for them. This is a misconception that should be cleared up. Depression does not make you a weak person. Many people experience depression and it as a legitimate health issue. You don at need to feel shame for something that is hurting you. You can get help. However, for these and many other reasons, people who ave been dealing with depression for a long time are often experts or ""great actors"" at presenting a cheerful face to the world, all the while living without hope or joy, day after day. What Is Depression? According to the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, depression is a mood disorder characterized by low moods and a loss of interest in life. A person with depression feels depressed for more than two weeks at a time, and as a result has trouble focusing and experiencing low self-esteem. There are many factors that can trigger depression, including grief, traumatic experiences, and genetics. There are many different types of depression, including major depression, persistent depressive disorder, and seasonal affective disorder. The most common type is major depression, and according to the National Institute of Mental Health, about 8.4% of U.S. adults have experienced major depression at some point. And according to Healthline media websites, about 18.5% of American adults have experienced any form of depression at some point in their lives. These statistics should show that depression is not a small issue and is quite an epidemic. Because of this, depression is the subject of many peer reviewed studies and medical research. Despite its prevalence, few people recognize depression in their loved ones and even fewer wish to to talk about it. Talking About Depression We need to discuss an extremely important point in this article. If you suspect a colleague or friend that may be depressed, think very carefully before you take any action. What you may intend to be a friendly and supportive conversation can easily come across as confrontational. Much of this depends on how well you know the person in question and what level of rapport you have. Many people, whether they are actually depressed or are just going through a rough patch, can benefit from having someone to talk to. You cannot, however, under any circumstances force someone to talk to you about their emotions. If the amateur diagnosis of psychological maladies is a hit and miss affair, novice attempts at counseling are often ill-advised. Qualified counselors and therapists will often spend several hours and multiple sessions with a patient before making anything other than a tentative diagnosis. They know enough to realize how difficult it is to know another person as internal state. Treatment plans are built over time spent between therapist and patient. Sessions are spent getting to know more about the patient as attitudes, personal history, any life factors influencing their emotional state and more - not just ticking boxes relating to depression signs. Only once all of this is understood does the treatment of whatever kind start in earnest. A well-intentioned but clueless acquaintance or family member, by contrast, often jumps right in with both feet, unburdened by any real insight but armed to the teeth with preconceptions. It frequently results in, instead of a productive and open conversation, a sermon on how a possibly depressed person ""should"" be feeling and how they ought to live their life. This approach isn at always worse than doing nothing, but that is the way to bet. At a minimum, this will most likely damage the person's trust in and respect for whoever offers such casual and unwanted advice. A much better way to handle a situation like this is to let the individual you are worried about know that you are here whenever they feel like talking. Even if it as not on your own behalf, it will also be well worth it to consult a professional counselor on the dos and don ats of discussing depression, much of which boils down to ""Listen, don at lecture."" If you recognize some of the depression symptoms below in yourself, getting professional counseling can be a good choice. Some people have a depressive episode lasting a few weeks once in their life and then it never happens again, but many others are encumbered with it for years without realizing that it as possible to do something about the situation. Having persistent episodes of depression is fairly common and treatable with a mental health professional that you trust. Treatment is rarely the easiest thing in the world. There as no miraculous ""happy pill"" that will make all your problems go away, nor any magical words a therapist can say to instantly cure you. Nevertheless, it pays to try this route, which offers the best chance of recovery or at least improvement in depressive symptoms and a better quality of life. A trained, licensed counselor offers total privacy, which is of fundamental importance to anyone who has trouble discussing his feelings or personal history. They also tend to have a large body of experience to draw on. While there is no ""one size fits all"" method to what they do, having seen dozens of the possible variations depression can present certainly helps in understanding it. Having dealt with patients from many different backgrounds also means that no counselor will feel that they are capable of knowing what is right or wrong in your context - life as far too complicated for that. This realization only comes through knowing what others are struggling with. Finally, a counselor wants nothing from you aside from a reasonable hourly fee. They don at want your friendship for some ulterior motive, nor do they feel the need to convince you of anything, and they certainly don at want you to become dependent on them. If you don at feel up to a face-to-face consultation, there are helpful online counseling services available. Online counseling is a safe way to discuss feelings of depression and can be less overwhelming to people who are struggling. Another component of this is that depression often comes with anxiety. If you are anxious about admitting you have depression, speaking to an online counselor can ease that anxiety. What Are Signs Of Depression? It as a very human desire to want to understand what is happening, particularly when it comes to someone special to us. However, especially after reading the preceding paragraphs, you should be mindful of the fact that there are many different levels of understanding. Assigning a label such as ""depressed"" to a complex, unique, thinking human being may be easy, but it as not helpful or accurate.  The signs of depression in men can be very different from the signs of depression in women, while the various social norms and individual attitudes mean that a cookie-cutter approach to recognizing illnesses such as depression is going to be wrong 90% of the time. Most people don at realize how widely people differ. Living in society tends to make us dress similarly, use language, in the same way, keep unusual opinions to ourselves and behave in the same ways as those around us. Scratch the surface, though, and you will discover how exceptional even unremarkable individuals can be. Psychological normality is a spectrum, not a standard. However, there are some factors common to many who experience depression. If someone you know - or you yourself - is displaying several of the following, it might be time to think about what you can do to help. The term ""depression"" only applies to a condition that continues for two weeks or more - everyone has bad days now and again, but this isn at a clinical syndrome. Loss Of Appetite Some of us can go on a diet, but a total lack of desire for food is a serious symptom of either depression or other medical conditions. Many people completely lose interest in eating and lose weight rapidly as a result. If someone as former favorite food might as well be boiled cardboard for all the interest they show in it, something is going on, whether it as depression or not. Since poor nutrition contributes to deepening depression, this can make things go from bad to worse. Paradoxically, some people who experience depression can also begin to overeat. It as not a question of how much and which food a person eats, but a change in behavior that continues for some time that needs to be paid attention to in a serious way. Risky Behaviors When someone thinks they have nothing to lose, even physical hazards seem like less of a problem. Compounding this danger is the fact that many depressives are prone to self-medicating with anything from alcohol to illegal narcotics, disregarding the immediate risk and long-term consequences in favor of escaping a persistently sad, empty state of being at least for a while. The possible results aren at limited to drunk driving or addiction. In a moment when they aren at capable of caring, those with depression may make decisions that will negatively affect their relationships and careers without a second thought. If someone who used to be protective of his physical possessions - a car, a CD collection, anything that has emotional value to him - suddenly becomes careless about it, definitely take notice. It may indicate depression or some other kind of psychiatric evolution, but neither of these is easy to go through alone. Physical Symptoms Of Depression Depression is not exclusively a mental illness. It involves the mind, the emotions as well as the rest of the body. It can be a contributing factor to many other health conditions, ranging from heart disease to digestive problems to frequent headaches. Bodily pain that doesn at respond to medical treatment is also common. Verbal Signs The aspect of depression that torments its victims most is certainly the effect it has on emotions. Everybody gets sad or worried sometimes, but having this as a nearly constant feature of your life can wear down even the strongest personality sooner or later. Often, some small part of this experience will come out in casual conversations. As with any sign of depression, this can be easy to misread. Many people are philosophical fatalists while remaining quite cheerful and enthusiastic about the future. If someone as comments start indicating feelings of powerlessness, a poor sense of self-worth or a total lack of hope that things will be better at some point, it is time to start listening closely to what they are actually saying. You all need to listen to every single word (without being paranoid). If someone starts using words like ""useless"", ""stupid"" or ""why bother"" in contexts that don at seem to fit, they might be experiencing a depressive state. If they start talking about suicide or self-harm, even obliquely such as by discussing an incident on the news, it is usually time to seek professional help. A comment such as ""people will be better off without me"" should never be ignored. If you or a loved one are experiencing suicidal thoughts, reach out for help immediately. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline can be reached at 1-800-273-8255, and is available 24/7. Fatigue, Insomnia, And Lack Of Concentration Many people who are feeling depressed are prone to fatigue, excessive sleeping, and difficulty concentrating. As with so many depression signs, these can be caused by anything from severe clinical depression to a viral infection to worrying about overdraft fees from the bank. However, if these symptoms persist for a long time, something is certainly wrong. Treating them only on a surface level, for instance by drinking gallons of coffee during the day only to take a sleeping pill at night, is no more than a Band-Aid that doesn at address the more core psychological problems. Loss Of Interest In Pleasurable Activities This refers to sex in particular. A person as libido is one of the things heaviest hit by depression. However, it can equally well apply to hobbies such as socializing, playing or watching sports, camping, or whatever somebody used to do to have fun. One of the effects of depression is to suck the joy and significance out of almost everything, regardless of how much it ""should"" mean or how much you ""should"" enjoy it. A Sudden And Inexplicable Improvement In Mood At first, it can seem like a wonderful thing that your loved one is feeling better. But in some cases, people become temporarily better only to sink back into depression again. However, this is one of the worst and most critical signs of severe depression, and you should help your friend or yourself find help. Signs of Depression In Teens Most parents don at realize what precarious situations their teenagers can find themselves in. Society has changed immensely in the last fifty years, and the role teenagers are expected to play in their community, along with their responsibilities and rights, is currently undefined. They are on the verge of coming into their full intellectual and emotional maturity, yet they have no life experience to guide their actions and attitudes and are subjected to dozens of contradictory messages on the subject. It as no wonder that teenagers are bewildered by the world they live in - it would be a miracle if they weren at. Additionally, teenagers are financially and socially insecure on a purely practical level. If a 25-year-old finds himself in a subjectively untenable situation, there as little stopping him from quitting his job or even packing his bags and moving to another city. A fifteen-year-old has no such options. He can at decide to give up school, can at earn enough money to live on, and probably doesn at have the basic coping skills necessary to embrace the independence he desires. This is a situation that often leads directly to depression - being trapped in a distressing situation without control over your circumstances (such as failing at preventing fraud/identity theft or experiencing a natural disaster) and with little hope of the situation improving within a reasonable span of time. These factors, along with things like hormonal shifts and academic pressure, often result in depression among adolescents. The signs indicating clinical depression in teens are much the same as those for adults, with the additional proviso that they tend to be less stuck in a routine and more changeable at their age. They are also less obligated to interact with the world at large than the average adult, which can make them more prone to withdrawing from family and friends if depressed. Don at Ignore The Warning Signs Of Depression. Get The Support You Deserve & NeedSpeak With A Licensed Depression Therapist They are also often reticent as far as communicating with their parents is concerned. It as not the worst idea in the world to make a counselor available to them for whatever issues they wish to discuss, whether relating to depression or not. A clear understanding of the implications of professional confidentiality will go a long way to enabling them to be able to discuss their problems and dilemmas with someone outside their peer group, which is conducive to making better decisions while also coping better in general. Signs Of Depression In Children It is estimated that as many as one in three children experience depression (thankfully, other statistics are significantly lower). This may seem impossible (and certainly unfair), but the fact is that children are subjected to stresses similar to those adults and adolescents face, if in a different form. They are hampered by the fact that it as impossible for them to communicate effectively, which often leads them to behave in ways designed to ""get attention"". Disruptive behavior at home or in school and high levels of anger or irritability may be concealing profound and persistent feelings of sadness. If your child is socially withdrawn, prone to apparently cause less emotional outbursts or excessively touchy in social interactions, it may mean nothing more than that you have a normal kid who as busy growing up and learning about the parameters of his world. It might also mean that he as struggling with feelings of emptiness and sadness that he as in no way equipped to deal with, and telling the difference is notoriously difficult. Leaving a case of genuine depression untreated can result in the illness persisting for years and even into adulthood, which will have a negative effect on a person as development. If you are concerned, the only way to determine whether or not a younger child is depressed is to consult a professional specializing in child psychology. This may end up saving both of you a ton of grief. Self-Evaluation Approximately half of the depression cases are untreated. Leaving the problem to sort itself out is rarely effective, and can cause the feeling to become more powerful and last far longer than necessary. If you feel that you are experiencing depression but aren at sure, it might be helpful to take a quick sign of depression quiz online or in a magazine to get more clarity. To a professional counselor, a Signs of Depression Test is of about as much clinical value as reading tealeaves, but they do have their uses. While you shouldn at regard their results - either way - as iron-clad, filling out one of these takes only a few minutes and can help guide your thoughts to the condition of your inner self. While this article focuses on detecting the signs of depression in people close to you, self-analysis is extremely difficult and often painful. If a tendency to shy away from examining how you are actually feeling is causing you to experience depression without seeking treatment, you are certainly causing yourself a huge amount of unnecessary discomfort. How To Treat Depression No matter who has depression, there are many different treatments and additional resources that can help. Luckily, many people with depression seek treatment and find joy in their life again. The best thing to do if you or a loved one has depression is talk to a counselor (such as those with BetterHelp) or other wellness professionals with relevant experience. By talking to a professional, you can securely process your emotions and find some relief. Furthermore, these professionals can provide an invaluable service by offering therapy for life's struggles, figuring out why the symptoms started, prescribing medication for the symptoms, or utilizing electroconvulsive therapy. However, if these options do not work for you, a mental health professional can discuss other treatments that may work better. In the case that you or a loved one has thought of suicide or have made sucidie attempts than please call the suicide prevention hotline (988) or a local emergency hotline for help. And if you are experiencing depression, or your mental health is simply not doing well, then getting emotional support from family members and other loved ones is essential. Talking to someone about your sudden switch to depression is essential for healing and finding joy in life again. If talking to family members is not an option, then you can find support from support groups. There are many support groups aimed to help people with depression and they can be just as effective as seeing a therapist. ",2022-08-23,Education
